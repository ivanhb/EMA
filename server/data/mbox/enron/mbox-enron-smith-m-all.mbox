Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Mat

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Subject:	Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and "Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  

Mat

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

Smith,
    Do you have any interest in this concert?   Matchbox Twenty, Life
House,
and some other band....  I have a ticket and I don't know if I am going,
but
if you want to go I can see if she has an extra ticket or you can have
mine.
Let me know!

Smith,
    Do you have any interest in this concert?   Matchbox Twenty, Life House,
and some other band....  I have a ticket and I don't know if I am going, but
if you want to go I can see if she has an extra ticket or you can have mine.
Let me know!

it, let me know and I will get some other takers for the tickets.  Thanks!

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Mat

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.  We'll definitely be hitting the 
town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

   Weekend of the 12-15 in April or the one following??

ps i got in another car accident that i didn't cause but still got blamed 
for it.  but we'll get into another time.

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities.

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

How about dropping by around 2 pm and I'll show you how I could set this up.

Tom,

Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are 
those on the Optimizer sheet:

Start/End Date
Spreads
Max Inj/With rates
Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great 
story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you 
want to chat sometime.

Hey boy.  HOw's it goin?  Hey, I just wanted to write to say thanks for the
fun while we were in Houston and the week in general, but mostly for taking
care of my drunk, annoying ass at the airport.  I think I was still a little
looped the next morning.  Totally sorry if that turned into a big
babysitting job for you!!!

So, did you have a fantastic weekend after we left?  How did you avoid the
freaks?  love, k

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.

Later.

Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

Mat

As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.

Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.

rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?  

Mat

Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.

Mateo

Hey, I don't know if you've been reading any of those emails today, but 
please tell me we (as in me and you) can do something other than hand out 
with those fucking losers.  You know Mark's all over this fucking thing!

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to 
figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat

will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Tom,

Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
decision making.  Speak to you soon.

Mat

I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was 
ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll 
just keep waiting.

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Mat

Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password 
coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, 
so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the 
necessary software as well.  Thanks.

Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my

Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
skiing!  

I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.

Stay cool.

Mateo.

I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.

Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late 
when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided 
not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did 
you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Mat

OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.

well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another 
media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll 
attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about 
you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes 
someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being 
emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a 
friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i 
could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each 
other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't 
like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with 
us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want 
that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

let me know what you think...

That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not 
have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, 
I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could 
also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k

Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat

Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it's 7 pm Wednesday and I still have 
not received any emails from you regarding the ski trip.

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a 
many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne 
and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities 
referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query 
facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order 
required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment 
inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at 
least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the 
table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as 
actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required 
for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.

So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
group on correspondance.

Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed 
early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9.

The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.  On American, 
the one's I sent are the about the only ones.  Continental has many available 
flights for about $35 more.

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
refresh it manually.  It sucks....

So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.

Later.

Jeanie,

As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El 
Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more 
info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be 
interested.  

See you around,

Mat

I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?  

Mat

I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.

Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know 
what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me 
know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since 
they didn't give us the technical tests.

Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not 
accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  

The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.

What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.

Pedro,

I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG 
a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I 
can do.

ENRON ROCKS!

From: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc: =20
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging 
out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I 
mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say 
about you.  Hope all is well.

I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I 
will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second

The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 
6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe 
I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is

told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Mat

Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the

Thanks you.

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.

Subject: Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, 
it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key 
violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but 
do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key 
violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be 
great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate 
degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY

These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

Yan,

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we 
discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report 
should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue 
should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new 
records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will 
leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Yup, my little bro is coming to visit.  We'll definitely be hitting the 
town.  Are you around?  I may organize something, so I'll let you know.

weather.  Are you in town this weekend?

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

   Weekend of the 12-15 in April or the one following??

is all set.  i did have to put the $100 on my credit card, but don't worry

ps i got in another car accident that i didn't cause but still got blamed 
for it.  but we'll get into another time.

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities.

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

Tom,

Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are 
those on the Optimizer sheet:

Start/End Date
Spreads
Max Inj/With rates
Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great 
story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you 
want to chat sometime.

Hey boy.  HOw's it goin?  Hey, I just wanted to write to say thanks for the
fun while we were in Houston and the week in general, but mostly for taking
care of my drunk, annoying ass at the airport.  I think I was still a little
looped the next morning.  Totally sorry if that turned into a big
babysitting job for you!!!

So, did you have a fantastic weekend after we left?  How did you avoid the
freaks?  love, k

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.

Later.

Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Mat

Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

Mat

As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.

Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.

Andrea,

I'm rotating as part of the trading track sometime before March 1st to the

Thanks.

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?

Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.

Mateo

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to 
figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat

will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Tom,

Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
decision making.  Speak to you soon.

I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was 
ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll 
just keep waiting.

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password 
coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, 
so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the 
necessary software as well.  Thanks.

Hey, just wanted to let you know I made $10,000 today (for me that is).  Just 
wanted to tell someone...it's for doing the trading track.

Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

Mat

Oh yes, I had a good time, although very exhausted from getting in late.  Did 
you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my 
wine stash was depleted.  Did you have anything to do with that?

Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
skiing!  

I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.

Stay cool.

Mateo.

I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.

Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late 
when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided 
not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did 
you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Mat

OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

Basically, you don't want to talk to me anymore :(  I just want to be 
loved....

Just kidding, I can't really respond right now, so I'll give you a call 
later.  I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off.

okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.

well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another 
media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll 
attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about 
you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes 
someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being 
emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a 
friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i 
could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each 
other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't 
like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with 
us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want 
that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

let me know what you think...

That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not 
have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, 
I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could 
also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k

Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a 
many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne 
and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities 
referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query 
facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order 
required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment 
inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at 
least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the 
table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as 
actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required 
for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.

So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
group on correspondance.

Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed

The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.  On American, 
the one's I sent are the about the only ones.  Continental has many available 
flights for about $35 more.

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would 
utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you 
should so you can send me an instant message.

Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
refresh it manually.  It sucks....

So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.

Later.

Mat

Agghhh, it's so nice to get email from you.  I was thinking about old times.

Jeanie,

As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El 
Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more 
info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be 
interested.  

See you around,

Mat

I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?  

Mat

I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.

Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know 
what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me 
know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since 
they didn't give us the technical tests.

What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Mat

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.

Pedro,

I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG 
a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I 
can do.

ENRON ROCKS!

From: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc: =20
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging 
out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I 
mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say 
about you.  Hope all is well.

I would look at it again, but I'm late for my class.  The only way to reach 
me is by pager - 713-716-0795.

Sorry,

Imad,

I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I 
will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second 
or third rotation?

The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 
6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe 
I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.

Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat

Don't get too excited to hear about the rest of the day...I don't have much

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Mat

Hey Matt,

How's it going?

When you get a chance, would you mind sending me the updated Net Inj/WD activity for SoCal for Thursday (10/25)?

I also had a question on the injection for 10-18-01.  When I was updating everything for last week's report, our ops report at the time showed a 366,000 injection, but now it's back to 101,000...  Which is the correct number?  Any idea why it does that?

Thanks Matt!
Sheila

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

CA - Place County Water Authority, City of Riverside

Also, as discussed, WAPA Billings was not used.

Let me know if you have any questions.

FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.

I

Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.
I
don't know if you are going to get this, but my work number is 503
219-8757.
Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Yeah thanks, I am feeling better.  This stuff makes me a little irritable,
but not too bad.  That woman has been nicer today, which is good.  I haven't
tried the phone yet.  But of course, I love email.  Ok, I am boring, talk to
you later.

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I continue to write to you, but you don't write back.  That's nice.
Anyways, I heard that Skamania lodge is a cool place to stay.  It is in
Washington, but just across the river from Hood River.  I don't know what
you think about that.  If you want, I can contact them.  I'll wait to hear
from you....

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Hello everyone,

	Colin asked me to send an email out reminding you all that we plan to play paintball on this Sunday (June 10th) at the Paintball USA field we used before (see link below for map if you didn't go last time).

	The cost came out to be around $40 per person last time, and this included everything, even lunch.  I imagine it will be about the same this time.  If I can get an approximate count of who's going to be coming, I can buy some paintballs ahead of time for cheaper, which might reduce the cost some.

	If you have any questions, contact myself or Colin!

Just as a heads-up...

Currently the sites for Kern, Questar, and Overthrust are having issues.  These will be watched for the remainder of the day, but it is possible that these sites will be problematic over the weekend.

Thanks,
Chris

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Matt - I would suggest you talk to Matt Gravelle from ConAgra.  I have done him some favors over the years.  They are a big food processor with Beatrice Hunt Wesson.  He will know all the big tomato processors which are 80% of the food processing load.  Others include Tri-Valley.  I would try to get as many names and phone numbers as you can and call them up and ask them their plans.  My bet is cooler and wetter weather will result in a lower and later harvest and hence gas usage.  
The fruit driers are the other 20% and they are much less concentrated and it will be hard to get a handle on their usage.

Also, what's up with EES?  Do they have any marketers anymore?  Dan Bergmann used to be very effective in getting deals done with the food processors, but they laid him off.

I would like to have Matt Smith, West Fundamentals, call you to discuss the food processing load in CA.  He wants to pick your brain on how to gather more information on this business sector.

Thanks,
Mike

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

You were going to send me Janie's phone contacts.  Do I need to wait until the master list is done, or can you send me just hers right now?  I'm trying to call on people to trade some imbalance gas this week.  thanks.

Morgan Stanley owns a power plant in Reno, off of Tuscarora.  The plant is a 360 MW peaker plant with an inefficient heat rate of 12500.  They reverse toll by selling Malin and buying either COB or NOB power.

	I  have decided to move Frank Ermis from his role as Prompt/Season - PG&E/Malin to Director of Trading in the Rockies.  He will assume the Prompt/Season role for Western and Eastern Rockies and term trading for the western Rockies.  Matt Lenhart will assume the responsibilities of Prompt/Season - PG&E/Malin.

	  
	I have attached the latest organization chart for your review.

Attached are 2 documents describing the reorganization of the west trading =
desk.  I have assigned new books to all of the traders except Phillip. We a=
re currently moving the August physical trades into the new books and plan =
to be finished tomorrow. You will continue to use your existing financial b=
ooks through July 31st.  All August physical deals done during bid week sho=
uld flow into the new physical books and the old financial books.   Your fi=
nancial trades will move on the night of July 1st after we calc.  Starting =
August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical=
 books.  Russ is working on adding the new books to the West Intramonth Pos=
ition Portfolio in Sitara.  You should be able to see your physical positio=
ns for August in the new books as soon as we get all of the deals moved (to=
morrow evening at the latest).  The positions will be close in the morning,=
 we just need to verify that we have not missed any deals and move all of t=
he intra-desk deals.  Please let me know if you have any questions or conce=
rns.

Take a look at the groups to visit west power at some point.  I will still need to discuss this rotation with the Portland guys before we set the dates.  Please take a look at the groups and make certain there are no conflicts with trading coverage.

Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue 
should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new 
records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will 
leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Amanda,

Please add add a link called "Plant Outages (portland)", to the Gas 
Fundamentals website under the Power tab.  The description is as follows:

"Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today."

Thanks.

Dipak,

As you requested, here are the West Desk's forecasts for California Reciepts 
minus instate production by month.  They are broken down into delivery points 
onto Socal and PGE's system.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  
Thanks.

Please move the file i sent you from the Testing tab to the West directory 
under the Pipeline tab.  I have updated it in the Testing tab so discard the

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities. 

Mat

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?  

Mat

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the 
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help 
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae 
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some 
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in 
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a 
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, 
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I 
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to 
hear what's happening on the island these days.  

Take care,

Mat

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

ENRON ROCKS!

From: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc: =20
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Steve,

as we have discussed,  I want to develop a model that can be used to 
determine the actual value of storage by looking at deals done in the past.  
In doing this, I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from 
Oracle by basis location.  It will need to pull Interest Rate, Gas Daily, 
Balance of the month (Swing Swap), Nymex and Basis.

Once all of the pricing curves are pulled, the model will make daily 
decisions based on price relative to each other to buy, sell or hold.

This will probably be an extensive project so see about the pulling of the 
curves first, and we can move forward from there.  Please call either myself 
or Matt Smith with any questions.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Mat

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Matteo-
Hey!  Got your message.  Thanks for letting me know you got in safely.  Did 
you really not wake me up because you thought I would rather sleep or did 
you come upstairs to find naked people?  I wondered that when I woke up and 
realised you had gone! :) Ooops!

Anyway, what a great night!  Very annoying that the others bailed, but a 
great time none-the-less.  I never realised how many cocktails I had 
consumed, until I woke up the next morning still feeling drunk. Wowe!

So, about Utah....what was the company you found the cheapy tickets at?  
Jeff is getting back to me this week with mountains and clubs and all that 
jazz.  I'll ask him what he recommends about lodging.  We'll be out and 
about so much that I think a B&B or a hotel would do.  If we were staying 
for longer and with a group of people I might look into phat little pads.  
Have you found a Sundance schedule? Are you still thinking the 17th-21st??   
  Can't Wait!!  Kristen

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

I entered it last night as a new deal in your book.  There was origination granted for this deal out of your book too.  Give me a call at 39185 (my phone is not working) or I can some up there.

I see now in Sitara that you booked it to ENA-IM WC CAL.  Should I change it to that in TAGG?

Ashley,

There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??

As they say, "All good things must come to an end."

Unfortunately, this is hardly ever more true than in the IT consulting realm.  I have been informed that as of this Friday (11/30/2001), my assignment here at Enron comes to an end.  Obviously, Enron's current economic uncertainty predicated the need to alleviate any and all "excess baggage" (read: consultant/contractor costs).

I truly have enjoyed my time here in the Gas Fundamentals group.  I have definitely learned a great deal from everyone, and hopefully have helped others to do the same.  I leave my contact information below, in hopes that if there is anything I can do for you in the future, you will not hesitate to get in touch with me (especially to let me know what time to be at Front Porch! ;-).

All kidding aside, this has been a great overall experience for me.  From now until Friday, I will be involved in handing off all projects/initiatives that I have been a part of (or directly responsible for).  If there is anything needed of me (between now and then), feel free to give me a call (x5-8885) or stop by (ECS 06836) prior to Friday.

Thanks for everything, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their future endeavors.

Sincerely,
Chris Hyde

Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

Thanks,
Chris

My physical hedge strips are not matching sitara for San Juan and Permian.  Please check the positions for DEC and take a look at how all of the transport is booked.

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Thanks,

Mike

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Aaron,



Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --


			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172


and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     


when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172





Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I tried calling but noone picked up the phone.  Anyway, I just wanted to ch=
eck and make sure you don't have any questions about running keystone and s=
ocal.  Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way unti=
l the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cen=
ts.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny=
).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market =
is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm ba=
ck to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  The=
se markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8=
000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in =
position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport=
 out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably wa=
nt to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.  Check with Patt=
i regarding the injection capacity since Socal raised it this weekend and t=
here may be other changes to the schedule.  I'm available for any questions=
 on my cell phone...832-444-7702.=20

Have fun,

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

As some of you may know, I have been working with Lindon Chiu of the IT department to generate real time, hourly graphs for various California data (load, imports, temperature).  We now have the preliminary graphs, and they can be accessed at:

 http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/main.asp (not the same link as the main fundamentals page)
(click on "Gas", "Testing", and then "Load and Temperature Charts")

These are the premilinary graphs which pull data from the Portland West Power database, so they will include only the data available in the Portland tables .  The finalized versions will actually scrape the various data straight from their original souces (Cal ISO website, Bonneville website), which will make them more reliable.

Please look at the graphs, and tell me what changes you would like, if any.  I will pass them along to Lindon before he starts work on the finalized graphs, which will eventually be included in the "Integrative Reporting System" for the entire floor.

Also, please forward to anyone else you think would be interested in these graphs.

As a reminder, the WSCC outages graphs can still be accessed at the main fundamentals webpage under "Gas", "Testing", "WSCC Outages".  

Please e-mail me with any questions or concerns.  Thank you!

Jason

Dear Traveler: 

As the busy holiday travel season begins, Northwest Airlines 
looks forward to welcoming you onboard our flights and wishes 
you a pleasant travel experience. We remind all travelers that 
extra security procedures are in place at all airports and 
we request your continued cooperation with these new requirements.   
Please consider the following travel tips as you prepare for 
your flights.

Allow for extra time at the airport.  Domestic travelers should 
arrive at the airport 75 minutes prior to departure. International 
travelers should arrive 2 hours in advance. 

Bring photo identification with you. All passengers age 18 and 
older must carry government-issued photo identification at all 
times and may be asked to show identification at check-in 
and during boarding. 

Avoid wrapping your holiday gifts prior to travel.  Due to the 
heightened airport security measures and the random and thorough 
nature of security searches, travelers should not bring wrapped 
packages on-board the aircraft. Please include your unwrapped 
gifts or packages with your checked luggage or ship your packages 
in advance of your departure.

Additionally, certain items cannot be carried onboard the aircraft 
and will not be allowed beyond security checkpoints. These items 
include knives/cutting instruments, all "non-safety" type razor 
blades, corkscrews, baseball bats, golf clubs, ski poles and hockey 
sticks.  If you do need these items, please plan to check them 
with your luggage. 

Northwest offers several convenient self-service check-in options 
to help speed your way through the airport.  E-Ticket customers 
may check in online from their home or office with nwa.com Check-In 
or use an E-Service Center located at most major airports in the U.S.  
WorldClubs members may continue to check-in at the club, but will 
need proper documentation to pass through security as noted below.  
Customers may also check-in at the airport check-in counters or 
at one of our many curbside check-in locations.  If you have proper 
ticket documentation and no luggage to check, you may proceed directly 
to your departure gate. 

As a final reminder, all passengers will need one of the following 
to pass through security checkpoints at the airport: 
- A receipt for an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- An itinerary generated by an airline or a travel agency confirming 
an electronic ticket - including ticket number
- Boarding Pass 
- A paper ticket

For more information about these travel tips or to view your current 
travel reservations, please visit us online at http://www.nwa.com.

We thank you again for choosing Northwest Airlines and we wish you a 
happy holiday season.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder

The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be

waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Matt,

Are you using regionID = 2?  That corresponds to Calif.  If you are using regionID 5, 6, or 7 (NP, SP, and ZP), then you are probably not getting any results.  We do not break up the Calif forecast into NP/SP/ZP.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.  Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.  They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.  If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.

Thanks!

I will take a look at it. It is valued correctly but for some reason that deals got booked with the 9th date so your p&l has some curve shift/changed deals to get you back to the full value.  
Our systems are down now but I will get the reports back to you asap.

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Mat

Matt,

There was a problem with your book on Friday night.  The IT group did not have it ready to calculate so I was unable to report it.  They will have this done today and I will then load your positions into TDS.  As of Friday you were short 30 NYMEX contracts in Dec-01.

Sorry for the delay.

Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

I am pleased to announce the following organizational changes within EGM Operations & Accounting effective immediately:

Todd Hall will be relocating to London and will assume responsibility for all EGM operational activities in London including Risk Management, Confirmations, Coordination & Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Todd will be working closely with the EGM business unit heads in London to ensure their businesses are being supported in an effective and efficient manner.

Cindy Horn will assume the role of EGM IT & Remote Office Controller.  She will be responsible for the oversight and coordination of all IT projects affecting the Operations group.  Her duties will include monitoring and reporting project timelines and expenses and ensuring IT is being utilized in the most cost-effective manner within Operations.  Cindy will also manage the operational activities of the Singapore and Tokyo offices and coordinate with the Sydney office in regards to EGM operations.

yes, I am serious.  In years past, there have been skinned cats found in
parks in Portland, espcially black cats.  I know it is gross, but it has
happened.  I would rather be safe than sorry.  You know, I wasn't trying to
preach to you in the last email, I'm sorry.

yes, you were a little intoxicated when we spoke last night, but you

sweet.  That is kind of creepy that it is a full moon on Halloween.  I
need
to keep my cat inside because people steal cats on Halloween and skin
them.
Well buck up little camper, in the scope of everything, things really
aren't
that bad.  You could have to have life altering surgury.  Since this
thing
with my family, it really has put a lot of things into perspective.  I
hope
you feel better.  Call me later.

Thank you.  Kim Olinger faxed me a copy of the August production and it reflected the correct volumes (43,559 mmbtu).  We are now tied except for the 3/00 and 8/00 as I stated yesterday.

Marlo,

The name and number of the person to contact regarding the billing discrepancy for July 2001 is Mary Reid @ 213-244-3898.  Gasselect clearly shows only one trade for 43,559 mmbtu's from account 2527 to Z99.

Mike,
Since the IT guys want to wait for the new software to put your cost analysis on the plasma screens I am currently working on using Reuters so that we'll have something in the meantime.  I had to call Lori Hernandez, Reuters contact, and have her add some more products to Kobra.  As soon as she gets back to me I'll put that together and get it on the screens.  Let me know if you have other questions.

Aaron

I just remembered something funny that happened on the bus this morning.
Remember the guy who I told you about, the one who gets excited when I get
on the bus.  Anyways, this morning he was staring at me as usual, and
instead of looking away, I smiled at him.  So when he got up to get off, he
asks me if I like cinnamon rolls.  I said no. And he said I will bring you
some tomorrow and then I said awesome.  Now, I have to take the earlier bus
so I won't have to see him.  This girl who I am friends with was sitting
next to me during the interaction and it was pretty funny.
ok, that is it.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Well, I did get all of my laundry done.  I went and picked up the uniform
and then went to a couple parties, they were fun.  I has my soccer game and
it sucked.  I think everyone on my team was hung over, and we lost.  I went
out to lunch and then to the mall, I bought some new jeans.  Later, I went
out to dinner and then to Fred Meyer.  It was very exciting.  Is there day
light savings time there?  I'm glad you had fun with your friend.  Did you
sleep in the same bed?  I only have a four day work week.  I am taking
Friday off for the surgury.  I am not yet freaking out, but I probably will
later.  I am tired and out of it today...moving a little slow.

Matt,

Here are a couple of links that might be helpful for planning your ski trip. 
  Could you also please forward this email on to Ted.  I forgot to copy him 
on my email last time that gave my forwarding info and I don't recall his 
last name.  He is planning to be in park city with some friends this winter 
and wanted to get in touch w/ me.
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the 
parkcity info website has some info on Sundance, you just have to dig 
through there to find it.
Take care,
Mo

Hey Mat,

I would like to talk with you some more about some of
the things we talked about the other day on the phone.
 I hope that you didn't think that I was calling you
all this time because there was a problem.  I have
been calling because I think we had a good time, and
you are a great guy.  I would love to keep in touch
with you and chat.  I know things are hard because you
are far away ( and I am far away from you!), but I
would like to continue talking with you.

I'll try to get ahold of you in the next couple of
days.  Hope you day is good!

Christine:)

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Hey, bro.  We're hitting the Front Porch for Happy Hour tonight if you're interested.  The way I figure it, you might as well drink some good beer while you're still employed.  PBR is just one credit downgrade away.

Later.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

I can come pick you up at around 1:00.  Do you need to be there an 1 1/2
early?  Call me to confirm.  I am not that busy today, and I have my car
already down here.  Plus, I want to say goodbye.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Matt,

You are being contacted on behalf of your business unit, CAO and the iPayit Team.  Our records indicate that you have one or more outstanding invoices in your iPayIt inbox waiting to be processed.  Please log into iPayit and address these outstanding invoices as soon as possible.  

Here are some FAQ's that might help you through the process:

Q: What if the invoice is already paid?
A: Log into iPayit and Reject the invoice.  In the comment section, please state that the invoice needs to be deleted because it has already been paid.

Q: What if the invoice does not belong to me?
A: If you know who it belongs to, log into iPayit and Forward the invoice to the proper individual who is responsible for coding and approving the invoice.  If you don't know who the invoice belongs to, log into iPayit and Reject the invoice.  In the comment section, state that the invoice was routed to the wrong person.

Q: What if I am waiting on some information on the invoice (such as proper coding) and the invoice is truly pending?
A: In iPayit, a Hold button was added to put an invoice on hold if an invoice was being worked on.

If you still have any issues or questions with iPayit, please contact me.


Thank you,

Howard Levine

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my 
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where 
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a 
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as 
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent 
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I 
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on 
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best 
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and 
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in 
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about 
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.  I
don't know if you are going to get this, but my work number is 503 219-8757.
Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Hey Mat!

How have you been?  I have been trying to call you to
chat, but can't get through to you.  Is everything ok?
 I wasn't sure exactly when you were going to
Portland, so maybe you are there now.  If you don't
want me to call, please let me know.

I hope all is well.  Please write me and let me know
what's up!

Christine:)

All,

As many of you already know, I decided to take a position at EES, so this week suppose to be my last week in the Gas Fundamentals Group.
It is a pretty satisfactory feeling to the reporting team and myself that we are able to contribute to the success of gas trading by providing over
100 reports every day. I certainly appreciated all your help, cooperation and friendship. Needless to say it was a great experience to work with 
you all. 

At Dave Dronet's request I'll stay one more week to transit my responsibilities to Kim Alexsander next week. Kim will lead the reporting team
and continue provide the excellent support to you all. The reporting team is in good hands. Even after I move to another group,
I am just a phone call away, I'll let you know my new phone # and continue to help you wherever I can. 

Thanks....


Yan Wang

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Here is the information that you guys had asked about last week when we discussed WSCC coal.  I added the railroads to the map and pulled some numbers for utilization and O&M costs for each of the plants we discussed.  If you have any other questions let me know.

What's up bro? Sorry I didn't respond on Friday - I was out and I never 
bothered to check my email. Enron is a good reason to move back to Houston - 
great company. I'm not heading to Homecoming and I don't think anyone our 
age or older is going back. Plus I don't think we are allowed back after 5 
year reunion. Which reminds me, where were you? You were missed.

Anyway, here's my numbers:

Work - 201-413-3584
Home - 201-792-4220
Cell - 917-603-7033

This is the new template for imbalance trades. So far, I think this is the one they want you to use.

I have set up a template in o:/common/logistics for the recording of imbalance trading as we discussed 
in our meeting on Friday. 

Let me know if this looks ok and if you think more information is needed.

Thanks,

the Financial Times (FT).

Commencing June 16, the full text from all editions of the FT,
including FT.com, will be accessible to all Publications Library
and CustomClips customers.  The FT will continue to be
unavailable in Business Newsstand. The rollout of the full text of
the FT complements Factiva's compelling content set of top must-read
global business sources including The Wall Street Journal and
Dow Jones, Reuters and AP Newswires. In addition, this unique
source combination will be offered at launch in Factiva.com, our
new flagship product.

The full text will replace the FT Abstracts. In order to provide
you with uninterrupted coverage, the full text of all articles
from June 1 on will be made available. The FT abstract archive
to date will continue to be accessible to you as well.

This change will require no action on your part. The full text of
the FT will have the same source codes that were previously applied
to the FT Abstracts. This means your CustomClips folders and saved
searches will automatically get this expanded content - and it will
be available on day of publication to provide you with the most
up-to-date global business information.

If you have any questions, please contact your account executive.

Regards,

Greg Gerdy
Vice President and Director, Product Management

Hey everyone!
So, this Friday is my 27th (YIKES!!) birthday.  I plan on going over to Little Woodrows (by Brazos and Hadley) around 5:00 to celebrate.  Please come and help me forget that I'm that much closer to 30.  (No, Massimo, I'm not going to do 27 shots!)
Not sure what the plan is after Little Woodrows, but we'll go from there.
Feel free to invite anyone else I may have left off the list.
Hope to see you then!
Tara

Eddie,

We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.  The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.  Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.  We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.

The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.  The pipes in question are:

-  National Fuel and Gas
	This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.  Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.

-  TCO
	We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.  Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.

-  CGT
	This is a "sister" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.  We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.  I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.  It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).

And that's it!!  TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.  So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.

Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!? ;-)

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

Unfortunately for this particular trip there is no flexibility in my
schedule.  The company is usually very good about this kind of stuff, but
we're in a crunch on this and many projects so it's just get out and get
back.  It looks like the best I can do getting an earlier flight is to be in
IAH by 7:55 with my flight to B'Ham at 9:55.  We'd have to get dinner at the
airport unfortunately, but it's better than nothing.  I'll call you
Wednesday and let you know what's happening.

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about
$100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my
fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go
to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could
stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work
pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have
my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat

   Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a
   month
   ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and
   I'll
   be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my
   layover is
   for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out
   of
   Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll
   call
   your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch
   the
   earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
   Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

   Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I
   see
   each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at
   the
   beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

It appears that the wrong service was stopped last night...a request to stop/restart the real-time weather service also seems to have resulted in the stopping of the Jaguar harvester.  This caused no scrape jobs to run last night.

This morning the service has been restarted, and data has been recovered.  This should be examined closely, as there is the possibility that information is the same for cycles 1 and 2 of certain pipes (this may or may not be an issue...if it is, please advise us on what should be done).

Thanks,
Chris

Please add the following new point to the database for PGT (#15) and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others:

This is a scraped point currently being posted.  This DRN is the same as the IHS DRN for this point. 

Thanks.

She just called me back and said they haven't been able to figure out how to bill for the fee yet, but her supervisor told her to go ahead and start pulling the info together.  She thinks she might have something towards the end of the week, and I asked her to let me know for sure on the timing.  One thing -- they haven't closed May yet, so it may take a little longer to get than the previous months.

She is going to try to get hold of him right now, and she will call me back.  I'll follow up tomorrow.  (But feel free to call me if you haven't heard anything from me in a couple of days!!)

Becky,

Have you heard anything yet from Questar?  Now we also need data for May 24 through June 1st because their site did not report all week.  Should I give Lori a call again?

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze

First of all, don't ask me why I'm still up at this hour, 'cause even I don't know...but since I am, I guess I can be accomplishing something constructive, so here goes:
 
Questar appears to have returned to normal.  Their data is now up to date, and I have re-enabled all of the jobs.  Hopefully things are back to normal for them...
 
Overthrust appears to be back up, albeit at a slightly different URL ( they moved from:
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/r30cgi32.exe?piprodit>
to
<http://152.137.64.16/cgi-bin/rwcgi60.exe?piprodit> ).
 
A slight change, but enough to affect us (if ONE character changes in the URL, it affects us).  So, I have modified the capture jobs for Overthrust to use this new URL...hopefully they also have stabilized.
 
Now, there is still data that has been missed for these pipes...we should look into possible recovery at the earliest convenience.
 
Anyway, just wanted to give everyone a heads-up of the happenings...
 
Thanks,
Chris

Guys,

I am really glad that the report generations were working fine during the period when I was away, 
thanks to the efforts of Kim, Lindon and Angela. But I am so sad that you don't have to have me around anymore for your reports ...

Hereby I'd like to give you an update on a few issues we fixed/fixing.
	a) Code has been added to show the Storage balance in the historical report instead of average
	b) Because OLAP cube interprets Null as 0 value, we saw monthly average to be 0 but actually should be Null,
	we've added code to detect Null value so that "NA" will be shown for monthly average rather than 0.
	c) Some pipeline (e.g. PGE) broadcast forward (future) flow, so in the end of the month, the latest month in Time
	dimension of the cube does not indicate the correct one. For instance, today is May. 31, the latest month in Time
	dimension is already June, which cause problems in historical report. It has been fixed.
	e) Central historical reports have been made fit to one page, and extra sheets on the interactive ones have been removed.

Matt: In order for the above items to take effect please verify with the executable Kim give you and let us know so that we can use it to replace
the one currently used for report generation. 

Another thing I talked with Matt was the Maximum Capacity column. I understand that you'd like to remove that column for reports which do
not report this value, however it involves big structure change to take one column away. I am wondering if we can put "NA" or use some other wording
such as "not reported" instead to save coding time and structure change. I need your feedback on this. 

One last item is that I checked the log for both daily and historical report and noticed that there are still quite some points their report setting are not quite
right. Please take a look at the attached, if it is a report you are responsible, make sure the settings are right so we don't see error in the log.

Thanks, I'll try to write short email next time.

Yan x33228

Phil,

Mat Smith can help you with gathering the data.  The data is stored in a SQL database and can be easily transferred into Access or Excel.  Also, the original Excel files where the data has been gathered for the last few years are still available.  Please let Mat know which points you need, and he will help you gather the data.

Chris,

I am working with Julia Gomez and Barry Tycholiz on a fundamentals presentation.  One of the things I am after is pipeline load factor data for points into California, the Pacific Northwest and from the Rockies, San Juan, and Permian basins.  

Where can I find historical monthly information (i.e. going back at least a couple of years) for this data?  I have copies of the sheets that Tara puts out, but ideally the data would be in excel format.  I know that you have converted a lot of the old spreadsheets to a new pdf format.

Let me know.

Thanks,

Phil Polsky

Apologies to anyone I did not include on the mail I sent earlier today...

As a recap, we had some issues this weekend with Questar, Overthrust, and
one cycle each of Kinder Morgan and Transcolorado.

I reset all failed jobs this afternoon, and Overthrust appears to still be
having problems as I write this...cycles 1 and 3 for Overthrust have failed
again, due to web site errors.

As stated previously, we should look into attempting to recover missed data
for the afforementioned pipes as soon as possible.  Also, a call to
Overthrust might be in order, to see if they expect any more down time.

Thanks,
Chris

Questar appears to not have updated their data since 05/23/2001...files we scraped over this weekend contain no data after that date...
 
Overthrust appears to have had problems with their site this weekend.  All cycles failed this weekend.
 
Transcolorado Deliveries / Kinder Morgan Segments Cycle 4 also had some issues this weekend...those jobs have been reset as well.
 
I have reset all of the above jobs, but we may need to look into recovering data for the lost days.
 
Chris

Just as a heads up...

The web site that serves data for Kinder Morgan, Transcolorado, NGPL, etc. is having issues as I write this.  The following message comes up when trying to receive point data:

An error occurred while executing the page. Please use the "Back" button on your browser to try again, or try again at a later time. If the problem persists, please contact ApplicationName Support (user@kne.com). 
The error message is:
[INTERSOLV][ODBC SQL Server driver][SQL Server]ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.

Basically, this means their server currently has issues.  I just wanted to send this out as a heads up that we could potentially miss some cycle information for the morning reports.  Hopefully, the site will stabilize before then.


Thanks,
Chris

OKay, so I thought the weather might get better but it's looking as if
Sunday and Monday may be the only nice weather we will have, if at all.  so,
let's plan on that day/night/day combo for boating activities.  If that
weater starts to change for the worst, do we want to postpone for another
sunnier weekend and/or just take the festivities somewhere indoors??

love, k

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze

Dear MATHEW,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 2 of the markets

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to "Internal Server Errors".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

um, I don't really know.  I did a search for "VB6" and did find one file.  When you get a chance, can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look.  Thanks.

Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Thanks,

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

Mat

um, I don't really know.  I did a search for "VB6" and did find one file.  When you get a chance, can you make the long journey across the isle to take a look.  Thanks.

Mat,

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Thanks,

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

Mat

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a rele=
ase capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide=
 daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effec=
tive if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers =
on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical dat=
a on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeli=
ne.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward=
.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data po=
sted on the web site

   I discussed your request with my supervisor and we are happy to provide
   you with the dialy use reports that you've requested for the points
   where you  actively move gas.  We do not have the resources at this time
   to provide data for all points on our system.  If you can give me a list
   of specific points I can get those for you by tomorrow afternoon.  I
   would suggest that you refer to our web site for other data.  Pipeviewer
   posts daily billing estimates for all meters and up to 30 days history
   for those meters.

I have the changes in place in order to start capturing the storage balance(s) for the 2 identified PG&E points ("PG&E Storage" and "Wild Goose Storage").  The next scrape time for PG&E is 12:30 today, so we can evaluate the first run of these values shortly after that.

Through the end of the week (and even beyond), this data should be monitored closely, to make sure the calculations are correct.

Any questions/concerns, let me know.

Did we fix this yet?  I can't remember.
We will have to wait on EPNG- probably sometime next week.  UGH.  I just want to get it done!

Tara,

It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).  So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.

Hey baby,
Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

I'm meeting Mom at the lake this evening.  We'll be home sometime Sunday.

I guess I can't play golf with you anymore.

Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to
the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.  They couldn't give me a
time, though.  I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.

Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know,
is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.  A round costs at least $100,
but free for me.  I better get to the range tomorrow.  Unfortunately
every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so
i'm really in trouble.  Oh well.....

Talk to you soon.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: "Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Subject: Questar


As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a "surface" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:
 
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70
 
I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.
 
JCP

Dear Matthew,

HB 1877, by Rep. Patricia Gray, has been set on the House of
Representatives Calendar for debate TODAY, Wednesday, May 09, 2001.

This bill would protect your right to choose where you purchase your
contact lenses by providing for automatic release of contact lens
prescriptions upon final fitting and allowing for a faxed copy of your
prescription, instead of requiring a hand written original.

Legislators need to hear from contact lens wearers in support of this
important bill IMMEDIATELY.

Please call your state representative's office now and let them know:
1) You are a constituent of their district.
2) You would like them to vote for HB 1877.
3) You support automatic release of contact lens prescriptions, and a faxed
copy instead of an original handwritten one because it protects your right
to choose where you buy your contact lenses.

Here is your legislator's information
Beverly Woolley
Phone: 512-463-0696

We know this is short notice, but at the end of legislative session things
change quickly.  Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

Sincerely,


1-800 CONTACTS
Texas@1800contacts.com


If you would like to be removed from our reminder list, please reply to

always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

Anyone interested in PAINTBALL ... on the 13th May (Sunday) ? 

I was thinking that could either go to:
http://home.houston.rr.com/houstonpaintball/paintball-fields.html#TWISTED

or 

http://home.houston.rr.com/houstonpaintball/paintball-fields.html#AVILLAGE

... you can get an idea of the costs etc.

Forward this to anyone who you think would like to go. 

Please let me know before COB Thursday so I can gauge the numbers. 

-Colin

All,
Enclosed is a list of specific cities that we are planning to scrape for the weather database.  It is sorted by state.  
Please look this over and let me know about any other cities that need to be included in the list.  Keep in mind that we will be using this data primarily for models, so look for cities you think will be important to your area of concern.  
Don't worry about the station ID or the WBAN codes, I will take care of those.
Please let me know by the end of the day Wednesday.  
Thanks,
Tara

Amanda,

Under the Power table in the Plant Outages folder on the fundy website, we have a link for California ISO outages.  Please change the link to point to the file called "pge_ISO_Outages.htm" in the testing folder instead of the existing file.  Thanks.

Martin Cuilla has kindly agreed to offer his time to help us understand some of the key concepts as trading Natural Gas. Therefore, starting sometime next week, we will be arranging a weekly Q/A. 

Please forward me any questions/topics you wish to discuss, so we can organize an itinerary, i.e.:

What products do we trade?
How do you manage risk ?
What does this floor trade on a daily basis?
Overview his job function?
How is P/L calculated throughout/end of day?
The difference between physical and financial products?
The difference between Nymex, Basis, Cash, Prompt Physical, Prompt Financial, Term, ROM etc?
Explanation of the concept of Basis Differential?
How do transportation costs affect Basis calculations?
How the Nymex products affect the above... i.e. auto hedge?
What are the downstream systems, i.e. Sitara for physical etc? 

-Colin

hey guys,

sorry for being such a bum by not keeping in touch.  i've been VERY stressed
recently.  i have pretty much avoided all communication with anyone and
locked myself indoors.  and, (you'll find this hard to believe), i haven't
even been going out!  i am really nervous about my exam, so i've just been
trying to concentrate on studying.  after my exam (2 weeks from wednesday),
 i will be SO ready to party.  i promise i'll get in touch afterwards.
until then, i am going to continue my seclusion...

see ya,
kathy

Project Mom @ Friendly Haven on Saturday, May 11th.... in Honor of Mother's  Day!
Join Enron employees at Friendly Haven, a housing assistance program supported by AFH (AIDS Foundation Houston), for a volunteer project designed to celebrate Mother's Day.  Approximately 40 single mothers comprise Friendly Haven's residents and we would like to make the day special for both them and their children.  

Enron volunteers are needed to facilitate a children's craft activity for Mother's Day presents and also serve a special brunch to all of the mothers in the program.  This project can be utilized as a team building opportunity for a department with 15 - 25 employees or individual volunteers may sign up by contacting Janice Riedel at x37507  - for more information on AFH, visit http://www.aidshelp.org/programs/housing.htm.

The Contemporary Arts Museum needs volunteers to help with CAM*boree, a special event for kids Sunday May 20, 5:00pm to 8:00pm.  There will be a picnic dinner, music and artist-led activities.  Volunteers will help play with the kids, ages 2-12.  It is so much fun and a short time commitment.  Volunteers get a FREE Museum membership as a thank you.  Please respond by May 16 to Jennifer Milligan X35272.


Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Looks like my mother was wrong when she said nothing good would ever come out of hanging around in bars.  My business card got pulled out of a fishbowl and I won a party for this Friday. So- anyone up for free beer?

All the details are in the attachment.  Check it out and let me know if you can make it.

Amanda, 

Can you please add a link to Gas Fundy under the Testing tab called "West Cash Trades".   The file is called WestCashTrades.htm.  The description is, "Daily cash trade volumes by counterparty for West region locations."  Thanks.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

Subject:	Plant Outage Task

Colin,

Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  


Thanks for your help.

Mat

Guys,

Some of you have noticed that on many of today's reports, we are able to see flow value for a meter for 5/1/2000, but the MDT column showed
"na" on the daily report. "na" is also shown on the historical report for the average of May.  It is very easy to get confused (at least I was in the beginnieng, even 
though I wrote the program myself) when you see things like this, you may ask why isn't the average the value shown for today since there is 
only one day's data? The answer is that they are from different cycles. Coding used the business logic that grab the flow value from the latest
successful cycle,  while always use the last cycle when deal with average. At the time of report generation if the last cycle is not available, this will
happen. Fortunately this only happens on the first day of each month.

Please explain this to those who may raise this question when they see this "discrepancy".


Yan

All:

Just as a follow up to the mail I sent yesterday, what I found out this morning is that all reports generation based on 
the 1st cub processing are successful, after I moved the cube processing time back to 2:30 AM. This probably tells
us that we need to leave enough time between the last scraping  and the cube processing, although what caused 
the blow-up yesterday is still mysterious. The lesson is when it is working, do not make changes, or it may break.  

There are still a  few format issues I need to fix.

Yan

Subject:	issue with report generation issue

All:

As you all noticed that on many of our morning reports today "NA" were put there as today's data,
that means at the time those reports were generated today's data were not in the cube, so the report
engine put "NA" there. However, by looking at the Retrieved_DTM field in the Meter_Usage_Stat
table in our database it showed that the scrapings were successful for all west pipelines as of 
11 PM last night. When I checked the history log of cube processing, the cube were processed  
successfully both times at 11:59 PM last night and 6:30 AM this morning, respectively.

We process cube twice in the morning, the purpose of second processing is to grab those manual entry data.
Reports generated after second processing (CIG_WIC, SoCal, and Rockies Production) were all successful.
Only those reports generated after first processing are problematic. So only two possibilities I can thick of can
explain this: 1) Although processing log showed success, it did not actually grab newly entered data to the cube with 
the first procssing. 2) Those data were not in the database table at the time of first processing.

I believe the true reason has to be one of the above. But my investigation so far can not give me any clue as what
could have caused one of above. Because if 1) was true, we'll need ask Microsoft on the consistency of cube processing,
cube processing has never failed us before. If 2) was true, it could not explain why in the Retrieved_DTM column of
Meter_Usage_Stat table showed us that before the first processing the data were already in the database.


My intention to move the first processing time from 2:30 AM to 11:59 PM was to have more time between the two processing 
to take care of the growing number of reports we are generating. I thought 1 hour difference between the last scraping and 
cube processing should be enough. That was the only change I made last week and we had not experience such a problem 
before this change. 

So without knowing the true cause of the problem, what I am going to do is to move the 1st cube processing
time back to 2:30 AM to see if it corrects the problem. I'll try to be here early tomorrow morning to make sure 
all the reports run fine.

I welcome your suggestions and comments on the possible cause of the problem to suggestions on how to prevent this from
happening again.

Thanks

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at (713) 853-7127

I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to "join" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name
and a unique ISO or WSCC identifying code.  I can be reached at 713-853-0472

1. If you're too open minded, your brains will fall out. 
2. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity. 
3. Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than going 
to a garage makes you a mechanic. 
4. Artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. 
5. If you must choose between two evils, pick the one you've never tried 
before. 
6. My idea of housework is to sweep the room with a glance. 
7. Not one shred of evidence supports the notion that life is serious. 
8. It is easier to get forgiveness than permission. 
9. For every action, there is an equal and opposite government program. 
10. If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip. 
11. Bills travel through the mail at twice the speed of checks. 
12. A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good. 
13. Eat well, stay fit, die anyway. 
14. Men are from earth. Women are from earth. Deal with it. 
15. No husband has ever been shot while doing the dishes. 
16. A balanced diet is a cookie in each hand. 
17. Middle age is when broadness of the mind and narrowness of the waist 
change              places. 
18. Opportunities always look bigger going than coming. 
19. Junk is something you've kept for years and throw away three weeks 
 before you need it. 
20. There is always one more imbecile than you counted on.

when you make it again. 
22. By the time you can make ends meet, they move the ends. 
23. Thou shalt not weigh more than thy refrigerator. 
24. Someone who thinks logically provides a nice contrast to the real world. 
25. Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves for they shall never cease 
to be amused.

Dear MATHEW,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 1 of the markets

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

Matt, I think I cracked the query to give a counterparty based position of the SoCal product you requested. Can you (or Mike) varify the following numbers (COB 04/27/2001) ? I was unable at this point to net the volumes in one sweep .....

Chris,

Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.

"If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."  - George S. Patton, Jr.
 
Keeping with our Mind's Eye Madness week, be sure to check out the Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade 
on Friday, April 27th from 11:30am to 1:00pm at the Big E Cafe.  This art car convoy will spend the day visiting 
Enron-designated stops in the community to promote innovation and creativity.  Mirroring Enron's innovation, 
these artists think about the way things could be and are not limited by the way things are.

Featuring:
Lunch by Escalantes Mexican Grille - choice of beef, chicken or veggie fajitas with trimmings, dessert and a drink for $5.  
Live salsa music will be provided by Tropicrew, featuring Enron's own Ms. Alex Villarreal as the lead singer.  
Non-profit organizations represented will include the March of Dimes, SEARCH and the Lupus Foundation of America.  
Get lunch free if you're dressed "freaky"!

Dear MATHEW,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 4 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the

Special Afternoon Workshop - 3:30pm to 5:30pm
"The Painting Experience" with Mr. Stewart Cubley 
You do not have to be an artist... no training or knowledge of art is required....  simply participate in a unique, 
supportive environment where you can explore the "process" of creativity and risk-taking completely free from the 
barriers of comparison, evaluation, judgment, success, failure or awards.  The only prerequisite is a spirit of inquiry.  
There is no fee for this class.  Please RSVP to Jessica at x31918 - space is limited.

Word of the Day
verve (v?rv) n. Energy and enthusiasm in the expression of ideas, 
especially in artistic performance or composition.

I had to move the AIESEC intern interviews to this afternoon due to the group meetings that were scheduled for yesterday afternoon.  Since the group meetings are now scheduled for today and I do not want to move the interviews again, you will be conducting the interviews and making recomendations on who to hire.  Here is the schedule:

All three of us will interview Milen and Grzegorz at 2:00 and 2:30.
Tara & Mat will interview Mohit and Guilherme at 3:00 and 3:30.
All three of us will interview Jenny on Thursday at 2:30.

Make sure their English and technical (Excel/Database) skill are sufficient.  If you would like, we can talk briefly about what to ask the candidates.  We will meet Thursday afternoon to make a decision.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

This is to let you know that for those of you who has a link to point to my machine to see the pipeline report, that link will not work any more. Because after checking with Tara and Matt, we made change in the report engine so that all reports are to write this folder O:\WebContent\Fundamentals\ENA\Gas\Pipelines\Ops Reports\. You'll need to go to http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com/gas/framework/default.asp, Testing section, and West Desk Operations Report, to see all the reports. 
Please forward the information to anyone who will run pipeline reports and not on my mailing list.  Thanks.

One last question Matt, are daily flow rates given for each of the pipelines - broken into smaller areas.  Meaning, are the numbers on a public site or do you have them?

Thanks

The Socal numbers are in MMBtu's and the PGE numbers are in 1000s of MMBtu's.

George,

Per our conversation, here's the requested information.  These forecasts are constantly evolving and this was a snapshot a few weeks ago, but it generally provides the required information.  If you wish to get into the detail we could spend some time next week.

Hello!!!!!  I haven't heard much from either of you concerning what we'd
like to do this year.  I have zero vacation since Matt & I are going to
Alaska in August for 2 weeks.  It's not Jazz Fest, but I wanted to let you
know that we have 2 good events coming up in B'Ham next month.

1.  May 12 - Crawfish Boil.  Annual event to raise money for charity.  Entry
fee: asked $5 donation.  Bands, good food, beer.  Options to spread a
blanket or bring a chair or just wander around and stand in front of stages
(2 to choose from).  See link below for more info.
http://www.crawfishboil.org/ <http://www.crawfishboil.org/>

2.  May 18-20 - City Stages.  This is our annual music festival.  Other
cities (Atlanta, Chattanooga, etc.) have patterned their events from this
one that's been going on for over 20 years.  I've been once and it was fun -
multiple stages - not Jazz Fest caliber, but what is?  Tickets are $20/day
or $35-40/weekend pass.  Again, food, beers, etc.  See link below for more
info.
http://www.citystages.org/ <http://www.citystages.org/>

Just wanted to put the offer out there to see if you guys were interested.
Obviously, we'd work it out so that whoever came could stay at my house (I
figure I can sleep ~10).  Let me know if you're interested or if you've
found anything else we might want to look into.

Subject:	March of Dimes

Hello All--

Shelley Corman has asked me to forward the attached letter to you regarding Enron's fundraising efforts on behalf of the March of Dimes.  

Please take a moment to review--any contribution you can make would be greatly appreciated and will be matched 100% by Enron.

Please ket me know if you have any questions or need any additional information

Thanks!
  
Please make checks payable to the March of Dimes and send to me at Location EB3275F. 
 
==========================================================================================================================
Dear ENA Team Member:
 
I am proud to serve as a sponsor of Enron's March of Dimes 2001 Walk Team.   March of Dimes is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Childhood health is a cause near and dear to my heart.   
 
Obviously, it is a cause that is near and dear to Enron employees as well.  Last year our Enron team raised over $46,000.   This year our team has set a goal to raise $75,000.  With your help, I believe we can achieve this aggressive goal. 
 
I understand that you are called upon to donate your time and money to many worthy causes and clearly I am not a seasoned fundraiser.  What I can tell you is that I am proud of our employees that have rallied a grassroots effort to support March of Dimes here at Enron.  I am committed to continuing their work.  I ask that you consider making a donation in any amount.  

Please use the attached envelope to make your donation to the March of Dimes and forward you check back to me by Friday, April 27th.  Your contribution is totally tax deductible and Enron will match your gift dollar for dollar (I will take care of the matching paperwork).  
 
Thanks, in advance, for your donation and support of the March of Dimes.  You can read more about the March of Dimes at www.modimes.org.  
 
Sincerely,

Suzanne Calcagno

George,

Per our conversation, here's the requested information.  These forecasts are constantly evolving and this was a snapshot a few weeks ago, but it generally provides the required information.  If you wish to get into the detail we could spend some time next week.

As per our discussion, I have done the following to fix the issues with Questar data:

-  dumped data from 02/04/2001 -> present, for all cycles
-  fixed the transform component to pull the proper column for utilized capacity and also to assign the correct effective date for each value
-  re-transformed and re-loaded ALL cycle 5 data (from the *htm files we have)

Now, in loading the 86 or so days back into the DB, approx. 3603 PRIMARY KEY violations were logged...this means that they are duplicating point data within the same day, same cycle, etc.  If this data could be examined more closely in the reports that are subsequently generated, we can make sure that things are truly copacetic from our side (a "surface" scan of the *.htm files shows that they are indeed duplicating points, usually with different names...the utilized capacity associated with these points is the same though, so this doesn't appear to be a big issue, except for the fact that we will continue to have primary key violations being logged).

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

Chris,

It seems like a test should include the final users of the manual entry - the fundamentals group can test it first, but Kevin Brady and Patti Sullivan are the ones that have to use it everyday.  My final point:  everyone listed on this e-mail needs to understand the urgency of finishing the scraping/reporting of the pipeline data.  After all, we are only three months beyond our original target date for the West and two months behind for the Central.  If you have any questions, see me.

Chris

Subject:	Manual Entry

I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential "bugs" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

"Previous" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just "Yesterday" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a "special cycle 0"...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add "extra" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the "Previous" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the "Exceptions Occurred" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to "beautify" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Regency garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

View your SAP Inbox directly in Outlook! Introducing the SAP Office Connector! 
The SAP Office Connector is a piece of software that seamlessly displays your SAP Office folders as Outlook folders. You already have the SAP Office Connector if you have the new SAPGUI 4.6D installed. If you are an SAP user, there are several reasons why you might receive an SAP Office message: 
?	You are the agent for an SAP workflow item 
?	An error has occurred for which you are the person responsible 
?	Someone (or some process) just sent you SAP mail
You can launch attached links to SAP transactions directly from Outlook, including workflow tasks!
Use of the SAP Office Connector is optional. If you use SAP only to enter your timesheet information, you probably won't get much mail in your SAP Inbox - and so probably won't benefit from using this product.
In most cases, it will make sense to use the SAP Office Connector to view your SAP notifications INSTEAD of forwarding them out of SAP to your Enron Internet mail address.  If you have configured your SAP Office to forward your mail, you should delete the forwarding when you enable the MAPI Connector.  See the attached document for more details on forwarding.
NOTE: there are several SAP systems, including Apollo Production (FI) and HR Production. You (may) have a separate set of SAP Office folders in each system. Repeat the setup steps in the attachment for EACH SAP system you want to be displayed as folders in Outlook.

I have added a cycle '0' to all pipelines in the database...per our discussion, this cycle will be used only in an 'emergency' type situation (we didn't scrape any data (for whatever reason), and there is some available that can be manually entered).  By being '0', this also shouldn't affect the logic of Yan's reports, since he pulls the latest cycle available (read the largest number; if ANY scraped data gets in the DB, it will be returned in place of any cycle 0 data).

Any questions, feel free to ask...

Chris

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Subject:	Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

You can create a folder like C:\program files\report engine\west report, and put above .exe in that folder,
you can run it by double click it (no parameter needed),  an Excel file can be found within the same folder
after running the report.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

All:

As you all know that the DRN within a pipeline should be unique, the DRN_description should be too. Otherwise
it will cause aggregation errors in our reports, values with the same DRN_description within a pipeline are all summed 
together. I have created a query called qry_Mulri_DRN_Names in the Access database O:\Fundy_ops\ReportSetting.mdb (Access 2000),
You can run this query to find out how many duplicates there are, and which pipeline they are. If you entered those duplicates,
you can work with Hyde or Eddie to have them corrected. Please also pay special attention when you enter new DRN and their 
descriptions. The rule is No Duplicate DRN or DRN descriptions are allowed within the same pipeline.
When in doubt, you can always run the query mentioned above to check duplicates. 

Let me know if you have questions. Thanks.

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of

Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:


Tim Belden	Ben Glisan	Danny McCarty	
Michael Brown	Joe Gold	Jeff McMahon	
Rick Buy	Mark Haedicke	Rob Milnthorp	
Wes Colwell	Jim Hughes	Matthew Scrimshaw	
David Cox	Louise Kitchen	Jeff Shankman	
Janet Dietrich	Michael Kopper	Richard Shapiro	
Dave Duran	John Lavorato	Marty Sunde	
Jim Fallon	Dan Leff		



Analyst/Associate PRC

The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.  Enron Europe will have the same committee evaluate analysts and associates.  This group will be chaired by John Sherriff and its membership is as follows:


Pierre Aury	Kevin Heffron	Andreas Radmacher	
Rob Bayley	Joe Hirl	Stuart Rexrode	
Paul Chivers	Chris Mahoney	Marcello Romano	
Markus Fiala	Christopher McKey	Bjarne Schieldrop	
David Gallagher	Roy Poyntz	Ron Slimp	
Bruce Garner	Paul Quilkey	Rob Stewart	

  


The associate PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Stan Horton and its membership is as follows:


Sally Beck 	Troy Henry	Kevin Presto 	
Jeremy Blachman	Sean Holmes 	Brad Richter 	
Don Black	Sean Long 	Stewart Seeligson	
Dan Castagnola 	Rodney Malcolm	Hunter Shively	
Joe Deffner	Scott Neal 	Jim Steffes 	
Kevin Garland	John Nowlan 	Andy Zipper 	
David Gorte	Ozzie Pagan 		



The analyst PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Steve Kean and its membership is as follows:


Federico Cerisoli 	Mark Jackson 	Everett Plante 	
Jennifer Fraser 	Ben Jacoby 	Paul Racicot 	
Derrick Davies	Steve Jernigan 	Angela Schwarz	
Scott Gahn 	Jay Lewis 	Ed Smida 	
Rod Hayslett	Cheryl Lipshutz 	Jon Thomsen 	
Rogers Herndon 	Michael Mann	Emilio Vicens 	
Brenda Herod 	Ed McMichael 	Frank Vickers 	
Kevin Howard 	Steve Meyers 		




Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.


Phillip Allen	Andy Fastow	Eric Shaw	
Robina Barker-Bennett	Kevin Garland	Hunter Shively	
Rick Causey	Ken Rice	Stu Staley	
Joe Deffner			



Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.

As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for "Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, "include an explicit discussion").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when "commenters" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after "consulting with respondents", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sends a signal!

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 31, 2001
ALJ Advocates Money Settlement in El Paso Dispute 
FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. yesterday "strongly encourage[d]" parties to reach a monetary settlement in the high-profile case in which California regulators have accused El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. (EPME) of illegally manipulating natural gas prices in California and committing affiliate violations. 
The parties should give "serious consideration to disposing of this case by a negotiated settlement," Wagner said in an order late Thursday, adding that it "would be in the interest of all" concerned. The pipeline capacity contracts at issue in the case "[have] been terminated for some time now; natural gas prices are down; and possible remedies, should abuse of market power or affiliate standards be found to exist, is not before the chief judge for decision, at least not at this point in time," he said. 
Both sides "will agree that this case is extremely complex and controversial, and will be a very difficult one for the Commission to decide regardless of the initial decision's findings, and it is almost certain that there will be appeals [of] the Commission's decision," Wagner noted. "This means that a final determination in this case is a long time in the future." 
However, "should a substantial monetary settlement be reached now, the people of California will benefit much earlier and perhaps much better than [from] a continuation of this litigation. The people of California deserve a quick end to this litigation and a settlement will provide them with a fair solution now." 
He believes the parties would be "wise to work out a solution to their disputes that they can live with and know the outcome of, rather than take a chance on what a judge, the Commission and the courts may find." However, this "admonition...is not to be construed in any way that [I] will decide this case one way or the other," Wagner said, adding that he "has not and will not reach a decision" until he has reviewed and digested all briefs and proposed findings filed in the case. 
Wagner presided over the hearing this summer exploring allegations that EPME intentionally withheld capacity from the market to drive up delivered prices for gas in California beginning in mid-2000, and that El Paso pipeline violated the Commission's affiliate standards by rigging the bidding process to favor affiliate EMPE during a February 2000 open season. EPME was awarded 1.22 Bcf/d of capacity on affiliate El Paso pipeline, which was more than one-third of the total capacity on its line. The 15-month contracts for the capacity expired in May. 
In the event parties cannot reach a resolution, Wagner has extended the date for parties to submit reply briefs by one week to Sept. 14, given that the "magnitude" of the case is "somewhat overwhelming." He noted that he still "will make every effort to issue [an] initial decision on or before Oct. 9" in the case.

Here is the latest....
Smart pigging was completed on line #1100 on August 17th
This data has neither been analyzed nor submitted to OPS for review
OPS must review this data before the line can come back up
Therefore, we now do not expect #1110 to come online until mid September/early October 
September 1st was the projected date that El Paso submitted to the OPS to have #1100 back on line

As additional information is received it will be forwarded.   Please contact me at x51623 or Kristin Walsh at x39510 if you have any questions.

According to El Paso, the only thing preventing line 1110 from coming back online is the delivery and installation of a release valve which OPS has ordered to be installed on the line.  We are now hearing that there is a possibility the September 1st date reported earlier this week could slip to the next couple of weeks to give additional time for the valve installation.  Furthermore, sources report that OPS has not begun the process of approving the entire system to return to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d, and this could take several months.  

As always, we will notify you as we learn new information. Please contact me at x51623 or Kristin Walsh at x39510 if you have any questions.

This ought to be very interesting!!

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : August 24, 2001
FERC's Wood Looking for a Few Good Executives 
Chairman designate Pat Wood III is looking for a few good energy executives to teach him and his FERC colleagues the ins and outs of the natural gas and electricity markets, specifically how to detect when something "smelly" is taking place. 
He's willing to pay a maximum salary of $133,700 -- which is what he'll be making as chairman -- for up to 10 executives who are interested in the task. That's the "top payment" that Congress will allow, Wood noted. He's also looking to hire an unspecified number of executives at a salary in the $115,000 range. Potential applicants should call him directly at (202) 208-0388, Wood said during an interview with NGI Thursday. 
"We've tried like crazy to get people. We can't compete on dollars...Government never competes on dollars. You got to get people who believe in this thing. There are people who want to do...something good for the [public]. I'm going to find those people," he noted, adding that this was a top priority with him. 
For interested executives, Wood said, "I'm going to give you the top [salary] I can pay you in the U.S. government, and I'm going to give you a helluva great workload in a critical industry that everybody in America depends on." 
He wants the executives to show him and the other four Commissioners "how it works." For example, "hedging and derivatives are great words" that are often tossed around, but Wood would like to know exactly how they work. "All five of us need to know everything about this business." 
Wood acknowledged that the new Market Observation Resource Center, which enables FERC to monitor the markets on a real-time basis throughout the day, has been a great addition at the Commission, but he says the agency needs people to decipher the data that it generates. "Getting the data is one thing, but having somebody that can assimilate that into something that tells you a story" is what FERC needs. 
He firmly believes that reported incidents of price manipulation and other market-power abuses will drop as the Commission's knowledge of the markets grows. "As we get smart on this, they won't try this stuff," Wood said, adding that it will "let them know [that] we're watching." 
Still, he admits that spotting price manipulation won't be easy for the Commission. "I think it's hard...even if you're really good at it."

El Paso Dealings Appear to Violate Rules, Judge Says (Update5)
By Jim Polson


Washington, Aug. 3 (Bloomberg) -- El Paso Corp. may have violated federal rules by letting its merchant energy unit outbid rivals for capacity on a natural-gas pipeline into California, a federal regulatory judge said.

Curtis Wagner, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief judge, is investigating accusations that the El Paso unit locked up more than a billion feet of capacity so other gas suppliers couldn't use it.

California utilities and government officials say El Paso used the transaction to cut the state's gas supplies and drive up prices. Wagner said he was disturbed by a transcript of telephone conversations between an El Paso merchant-energy executive and a salesman from the company's pipeline unit, who appeared to exchange information ensuring no rival could get the capacity.

``If that's not hanky-panky, there's no such thing,'' Wagner said at the hearing. ``This is the kind of stuff we passed affiliate standards to prevent, and now it's out in the open. I want to know if this sort of thing goes on every day, and I think the commission wants to know too.''

Patricia Shelton, El Paso pipeline unit president, disputed the judge's interpretation, saying the two men hadn't reached an agreement and that El Paso had followed FERC's rules properly.

The El Paso units didn't discuss the bidding process in advance, said Mark T. Mitchell, who handled the trading unit's bid. The telephone call mentioned by Wagner didn't affect the bid, Mitchell said.

Shares of El Paso fell $1.97, or 3.7 percent, to $51.25. They have fallen 28 percent this year.

El Paso's pipeline network is the biggest in North America, at more than 55,000 miles long. The Houston-based company also owns a separate merchant-trading unit that buys and sells gas.

FERC Rules

Under FERC rules, El Paso must give everyone who wants to move gas on its U.S. interstate pipelines an equal opportunity to bid for access. The rules also discourage or ban the company's pipeline and merchant units from sharing many types of information.

FERC is investigating why the average price of natural gas jumped almost fivefold in California in the first quarter from a year earlier and why prices in the state are higher than elsewhere in the U.S.

California's average electricity prices soared more than ninefold earlier in the first quarter, in part because of the cost of gas used to fuel many power plants.

New hearings into the issue started yesterday, and participants expect them to continue into next week. The judge held weeks of hearings on El Paso's role in California earlier this summer.

In addition to California's regulators, plaintiffs in the case included the state's two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International's Southern California Edison Co.

El Paso Chairman William Wise testified May 25 that he didn't come up with the plan to have the merchant unit bid for the pipeline capacity, though he did approve it. Wise said he didn't speak to the pipeline group about the contract.

El Paso Chief Executive Won't Testify at Gas Hearing (Update2)
By Jim Polson


Washington, Aug. 6 (Bloomberg) -- El Paso Corp. faces federal sanctions on its pipeline system, the longest in the U.S., if federal officials conclude its units violated rules on bidding for California pipeline capacity.

Curtis Wagner, U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law judge, said the company may lose its case because Chief Executive William Wise and other executives refused to counter evidence that El Paso favored its energy-trading unit in bidding for more than a billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity.

Wagner has ``a wide range'' of sanctions he may recommend to the commission by Oct. 2, FERC spokeswoman Tamara Young-Allen said. Testimony ended today.

``The burden of proof has now shifted to El Paso Corp.'' from California's utilities and state regulators, Wagner said after testimony by executives of El Paso's pipeline and energy trading units. He said he might rule against El Paso without persuasive testimony by Wise.

``In the end, we will be vindicated,'' El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said.

El Paso attorneys said Wise and other executives would only answer questions from Wagner. The judge said if they took the stand, they also would have to answer questions from California attorneys. When El Paso refused, Wagner adjourned the hearing.

Gas Prices

The FERC is looking into why the average price of gas jumped almost fivefold in California during the first quarter compared to a year earlier, and why prices there are higher than elsewhere in the country. Gas is used to fuel many power plants, and the average price of electricity at the California-Oregon border soared more than ninefold earlier this year.

California utilities and government officials say El Paso used the transaction last year to cut the state's gas supplies and drive up prices.

Wagner said he was disturbed by a transcript of telephone conversations between an El Paso merchant-energy executive and a salesman from the company's pipeline unit, who appeared to exchange information ensuring no rival could get the capacity.

``If ever a deal was made, there was a deal made there,'' Wagner said. He discounted testimony by El Paso pipeline and trading executives that the discussion was proper under federal rules and gave the trading unit no advantage in the bidding.

An April 14, 2000 memorandum to Wise and the head of El Paso's pipeline unit details ``what must happen for El Paso Merchant Energy to make it'' on the contract, Wagner said. ``If ever there were playing both sides of the fence, that's it.'' Wise testified before Wagner in May during the first round of hearings.

Competition Rules

Under FERC rules, El Paso must give everyone who wants to move gas on its U.S. interstate pipelines an equal opportunity to bid for access. The rules also discourage or ban the company's pipeline and merchant units from sharing many types of information.

In March, FERC exonerated El Paso of allegations it had favored its trading affiliate in pipeline capacity bidding, and ordered Wagner to hold hearings on whether it had manipulated gas prices. In June, after 17 days of hearings that included testimony by Wise and others, the commission allowed Wagner to expand his inquiry to include the handling of the pipeline contract.

Attorneys on both sides will make final arguments to Wagner in briefs due Aug. 24.

Shares of El Paso fell $1.30 to $49.95. They have fallen 30 percent this year.

The attached document will be filed tomorrow in the subject proceeding.  This differs slightly from the draft copy sent to you yesterday in that the party filing the comments is now Enron Corp., not jointly ENA and EES.  Language was also added requesting that FERC require El Paso to solicit CD turnback and use any turnback to satisfy its existing contractual obligations.

Attached is the draft of ENA/EES comments to be filed Thursday in the proceeding on the complaint filed by various producers, the CPUC, SoCal Gas, and SoCal Edison against El Paso Natural Gas, alleging that El Paso has oversold its system and that full requirements contracts should be converted to CD.  Our comments agree with the complainants, illustrated by EES experiences with Southwest Gas this past winter.

If you have any comments or questions about this filing, please let me or Leslie know by close of business (5:00 pm CDT) tomorrow.

The attached report summarizes the discussions at the subject technical conference held in D.C. on July 18 and 19.  Copies of documents referenced in the report are available on request.  Please let me know if you would like any of them.

More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online, there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 1.1 bcf/d. Therefore, once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso, the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service. OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days. The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review.

El Paso Announces Binding Open Season for Additional Capacity on Line 2000

HOUSTON, July 10 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Natural Gas Company, a subsidiary of El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG - news), announced today a binding open season for 320 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of pipeline capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The binding open season, which began July 5, 2001 and closes on August 2, 2001, is in response to the interest expressed during El Paso's non-binding open season in March 2001 soliciting shippers for potential system expansions.

The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to El Paso's Line 2000 from McCamey, Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, Arizona. The expansion capacity will be sold at El Paso's existing maximum California tariff rate, and the fuel charge is estimated to be 5 percent. The projected in-service date of the expansion facilities is mid-2003 subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory, environmental, and right-of-way authorizations.

The receipt points on El Paso's system for this capacity will be the Waha and Keystone pools in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. The delivery points will be Southern California Gas Company (SoCal) and PG&E's proposed North Baja Pipeline, El Paso's bi-directional lateral (Line 1903), any future incremental capacity on the SoCal system from Ehrenberg, Arizona into the State of California, and any upstream points on El Paso's south mainline system where capacity exists.

``This system expansion will add incremental interstate capacity to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas to meet increasing natural gas demands including the demand for natural gas to generate electricity for the western United States,'' said Patricia A. Shelton, president of El Paso Natural Gas Company.

Interested parties can contact their transportation marketing representative or Mr. Jerry W. Strange at (719) 520-4687.

El Paso Corporation is committed to meeting energy needs throughout North America and the world with operations that span the energy value chain from wellhead to electron. The company is focused on speeding the development of new technologies, such as clean coal and liquefied natural gas, to address critical energy shortages across the globe.

There's a changed deal in my book with Counterparty City of Pasadena.  I believe I originally input the deal to go to Mike's book, which is the correct book.  It appears that maybe you changed it thinking it was a mistake.  ??

Jason (et al):

We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.  We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:

1)  What are the requisite sites involved?  (URLs, etc)
2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?  (how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?  (this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)

These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.

Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.

Thanks,
Chris

Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my 
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, where 
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a 
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as 
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent 
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I 
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on 
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best 
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and 
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in 
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking about 
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

Steve,

As I remember the output from your power forecasting model gets stored in the MOD_Load table.  However, that table does not appear have results for California for the scenario ID 25 (New Model).  Does the California data have a different scenario ID?

Kam,

Hey, there's a nymex sale of 5000 /day Dec at 2.945 that shows up as a changed deal in my P&L from last night.  The deal is a valid sale that I executed, but it does not appear to be valued correctly.  It's valued at $3,096 when nymex was marked at 2.735 so the value should have been $32,550.  I would contact Ashley directly, but I don't know her last name.  Thanks.

Mat

Matt,

There was a problem with your book on Friday night.  The IT group did not have it ready to calculate so I was unable to report it.  They will have this done today and I will then load your positions into TDS.  As of Friday you were short 30 NYMEX contracts in Dec-01.

Sorry for the delay.

It appears my TDS is linked to Keith's book and not mine.  I don't mind having access to his position, and i actually will probably want it, but the book names probably got confused since his is WT and mine is WC.

Matt,

You're positions will not show up tonight until we "load" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.

Please call with any questions.

I am glad to hear that you're not freaking out.  As for Kate, she is pretty

Enron, so if she looses her job she won't be that sad.  I talked to her last
night and she seemed not to care one way or the other.  She said that
yesterday the traders were freaking out and most of them left the office for
"lunch" and didn't come back.  So, you aren't sure what you're going to do?
At least you have options.  Kate and I are going to see some motorcross
tonight and have some white-trash loving fun.  It should be interesting

Junky-Junk.



Moody's cuts Enron's ratings, may cut again

    NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's
Investors Service on Friday said it cut its long-term and
short-term ratings for embattled energy trader Enron Corp.
<ENE.N> and warned it could cut the ratings again because of a
substantial loss of investor confidence.
    Moody's cut Enron's senior unsecured debt ratings to
"Baa3," its lowest investment grade, from "Baa2." It also cut
the company's commercial paper rating to "Not Prime" from
"Prime-2."
    If Moody's cut Enron's long-term rating again, it would
take it to a junk level. A downgrade would make it tougher for
Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. The
downgrade also adds uncertainty to a potential merger with
rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, which has been in talks to acquire
Enron.
    Dynegy and Enron have asked for an expedited review of the
merger from Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
    Enron shares traded Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
down $1.15 at $7.25.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

See, bad stuff.



Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships

    NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N>, the
embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer
and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of
its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by
U.S. regulators.
    Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan,
managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina
Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
    Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with
four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in
a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with
Enron.
   Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at
$9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

I think the only thing that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's everything with you?

Scott,

I have your name listed as the contact for CQG (application). I have a gas trader, Matt Smith (msmith18), that would like to extract additional functionality out of the program, but it doesn't seem to be working correctly. If possible, can you please give me a contact name (if you aren't the appropriate resource) for the person in charge of functionality/training.

Please let me know if you can provide assistance.

If you aren't the contact for CQG, please send a reply and disregard this email.

Thanks!

Hi Matt,
I checked out the hydro data.  The Corps of Engineers changed the location of the files on their server, which is why our data is behind.  I've pointed our scraper to the new site, and the data is currently being imported into our database.

Sounds like a trick question...Obviously, you would take offence to me answering "no" for any reason at all.  However, I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason.  Though, if I answer "yes", it might imply that I don't like you now because you do not work at Enron, and somehow make you wish you did.  So....the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity (as long as it isn't too close), but who i like is regardless of employment.....

Let's see...I worked a little on Sunday, but wasn't too motivated because of all of the turmoil at the company.  Weather was really nice, so Mark and I went to a bar that's half outside to watch some football.  Only thing is, the one game we wanted to watch, wasn't on.  At least there was plenty of beer.  Then we went home and grilled some steaks.  I like steak.  That's about it.  How about you?  Did you get all of your laundry done.  I didn't.

  Could you also please forward this email on to Ted.  I forgot to copy him

last name.  He is planning to be in park city with some friends this winter 
and wanted to get in touch w/ me.
Let me know if you have any questions regarding park city.  I think the 
parkcity info website has some info on Sundance, you just have to dig 
through there to find it.
Take care,

Hey Matt,

How's it going?

When you get a chance, would you mind sending me the updated Net Inj/WD activity for SoCal for Thursday (10/25)?

I also had a question on the injection for 10-18-01.  When I was updating everything for last week's report, our ops report at the time showed a 366,000 injection, but now it's back to 101,000...  Which is the correct number?  Any idea why it does that?

Thanks Matt!

Hey, bro.  We're hitting the Front Porch for Happy Hour tonight if you're interested.  The way I figure it, you might as well drink some good beer while you're still employed.  PBR is just one credit downgrade away.

Later.

Bart,

Yes, you should be able to pull the loads.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  there are several "scenario" runs of the model.  You should only use the "New Model" scenario which, I believe, is number 25.

Hey, what up?  i'm still in Portland, in the office right now.  Had a prett=
y cool time this weekend.  Checked out Hood River, a little town on the Col=
umbia River Gorge and then headed up to Mt. Hood yesterday.  I think its ab=
out 11,000 ft high. There's a really old lodge half way up...it was almost =
snowing!  Actually, up near the summit you can ski year round....but i don'=
t think many people do.  The little trip made me think about our ski plans,=
 which we should definitely keep pursueing.  I apologize i'm a little out o=
f touch up here in Portland, maybe I'll do some surfing when i get a chance=
.  So, this chick fun...i don't really know what it is, but i feel comforta=
ble hanging out with her...I think maybe its just that she's pretty down to=
 earth.  She ski's a lot and plays soccer every week, so i guess there some=
 common interests there.  She's totally not into fancy expensive things...w=
hich is good because she's broke...want's to go back to school so she can t=
each.  Only other comment is that she's got a little hippie in her...but i =
guess you can't have everything...
=20
Anyway, I took some pictures, so I'll send them to you sometime.  I have to=
 run.  Thanks for the email.=20
=20
Talk to you soon.

Hey Matteo,

How's everything goin?  SO, I am so pumped about Utah.  I talked with my
friend Jeff and he told me so much more about Park City, skiing there, wher=
e
to go, the night life and the Sundance Festival.  He is going to write up a
bunch of stuff for us and would like to meet up with us for a day or two as
well.  We are planning on Martin Luther King weekend still??

I was thinking that maybe Brad and Heather might like to go as well.  Sent
out the invite to a few people, will know more by the end of the week.  I
say let's get the tickets and start planning.  Once I get the specifics on
ski places from Jeff, I'll have a better idea of where would be the best
place to crash.  By then maybe we will have a few more people commited and
can make a decision.  Sweet!

Also, last night I brought up the idea (to Duncan) of going to Australia in
February for a few weeks.  I know that you and Jeff have been thinking abou=
t
it.  Just thought I would let you know that we are too.

So, how did your weekend go with the chica????   love, k

not too bad...i was late to work, though.  Fortunately...the day is over for me.  I'm leaving for the airport shortly. AND, i'm in a good mood because some the girl that him my car called and confessed!  She said she thought she hit a garbage can, but when she heard from the girl having the party that someone hit my car...she realized it was her.  Anyway, she called her insurance and it's all good now.

Well, I should get going now...

See you soon.

I am sorry to keep bothering you, but what exactly does that mean.  I'm sure
you are busy, so this will be my last message.  Is there no availability at
the lodge, or are you unavailable.  You don't need to respond.  But at some
point before noon tomorrow, I will need to know your flight info.  

Keep it Real,

Mo,

Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.    

Mat

Susan and I are suffering from extreme neck pain this weekend from 
overenthusiastic dancing to "Nookie" at the Swan.  Just wanted to say thanks 
for hanging out, I really had a good time.  I didn't think I was going to 
get my second wind after dinner but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a 
monster hangover on Saturday and did not get out of pj's until 4pm..it was 
pathetic.  But I had a great time and its only fitting that I get sloshed on 
my last day.  Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W.
Mo.

Bart,

Sorry I didn't get back to you right away.  Because I had my hard drive switched out last week, I have to reinstall SQL server on my computer.  However, because of the latest virus scare, they've taken away my administrator access to my machine.  This should all be taken care of this week.  Please check back with me, and I should be able to provide you with the load data.

Mat

Ina,

Thanks for checking into it.  Coincidently, I noticed that there is a line on my phone called Portland #2 that noone uses.  If it's listed on the phone does that mean that it's necessarily there?  Maybe it was used at one time or another, but just got forgotten.  Anyway, it's not a big deal to wait until we get into the new building.

Thanks.

Ina,

It's getting even more complicated.  I forgot that the Portland office is also going through major renovation and system upgrades that would also effect the possibility of installing such a circuit.  At this time, because of the uncertainty of what items are being changed, moved or upgraded at each location and when these events would occur, makes the reliability of this circuit a major issue and should not be attempted until both locations have completed their locations' projects.

Ina,

I would have to investigate further to determine if this can be done, however, at this time we are not accepting any new circuits for the Trading floors because of the pending moves to ECS.  Direct circuits using Enron facilities is difficult when equipment using the circuit is in ECS and the equipment establishing the circuit to Portland is in ECN.  There are potential reliability problems.

Let me do some checking.

What would the cost be to se up a direct line between Portland and The West Gas Desk?  Are there any switches available for this where there would not be a cost?

Let me know what my options are.

That is as far as I got before I was put on this EES thing -- the rest of it exists in my head right now.  Sorry.  But the part you have should do a fair job of explaining the data issues.  I assume that in your visit here we will cover the information that ultimately will go into the other sections.

Aaron, this is Mike's latest sheet with all transporation path combinations included.  The files includes rates, receipt and delivery points, and live links to an EOL listen sheet.  It's basically everything you need to have an internet version developed.  Also, we do need an ops sheet modified.  Basically, we're trying to develop a net total for Keystone production.  More importantly, by the weekend we're going to need my Keytext Socal capture to work.  This is absolutely critical since we have a Nuke going out on Saturday and a major coal plant down.  Let me know if you have any issues.  Stop by sometime about the Keystone modification.

Hey,

You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already! 

Hope you're staying warm and dry.

No, this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was the

Maria,

Since you set my security up for the fundamentals database, I can't access any of the outage tables.  Can you make sure that I have access to those tables with my NT id "msmith18".  Previously, I would use the "gasintranet" ID and "fundamentals" password.  Thanks.

Chris,

Hey, I noticed that we have two Portland lines on our boxes.  No one is around right now, but I'm wondering if it works, or if anyone ever uses it.  I just got a box, and I have the second line programmed in.  If you get a chance, why don't you see if it works on your end.

Zo,

What's up my brother?  Long time no speak.  I just got your email from Scotty P (somehow he found me).  Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to Houston again for a job with Enron.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....

Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.

Hope all is well.

Mat

Hey,
Please send me Mat Smith's email.  I need to send him an email to get
him motivated to make the Whistler trip and I wanted to get his email
from you anyway.

I'll do a little more research on pricing.  For now tell him this:

Dates: arrive March 2nd and leave March 9th
Lodging:  $400 - $800 per person for 7 nights for 1 bdrm w/ kitchen,
walking dist. to lifts
Airfare:  $0 - $500 or so
Lift tickets:  $200-$250 for 6 tickets
Ground Trans.:  $60-$80 round trip from Vancouver to Whistler on shuttle

Food & drink:  ???, but the exchange rate is kicking ass at 1:1.55 and
the places we are looking at have a full kitchen with a fridge to hold

Rent Revenge of the Nerds sometime.  And no, it's nothing personally related to me.  

Anyway, this day is pretty much shot.  The highlight was deciding where we were all going to sit in the new building.  We move in November 9th.  Should be pretty cool.  I just remembered, I'm supposed to go to dinner with a bunch of people from the office and one of the brokers we work with.  We're going to a martini bar before hand.  Oooof, I'm going to have to find a second wind.  Must leave soon......

No, this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was the

on of fraternities.  Did you have some sort of run in?  Do you need to
share?

Hey there!

How was your birthday?  I wasn't able to get ahold of
you.  I feel badly because I wanted to wish you a
Happy one.  I hope that it was, and that you were able
to relax a little bit.

Do you know your new phone number?  I would like to
talk with you soon if you do.  I have news to tell
you!
Tis weekend is a long weekend.  I was originally
supposed to go to Boston, but Loretta and I changed
our minds.  I think she is moving into a new place
this weekend.

I hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Christine:)

To Whom This May Concern,

I have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order.  Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address.  In response, I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location.  The address should read Manor Way Office, but reference the specified apartment number.  Pete and Christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery.  If the offices are still considered "residential" you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge, which I understand to be not more than $30. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  713-853-047 (day)

Happy Birthday!  I hope this brings you much joy.  I know this is a little
demented, but it is sort of funny.  Since you don't know your address, this

Hey,

Nice to hear from you.  No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.  Just work work work.  Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.  When is a good time now?  I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.  By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.  Anyway, let's chat sometime... Talk to you soon.

then, but before I knew it it was 3am!!!!  So, what did you do to celebrate?

So this is the weekend you had thought about coming to Bean-Town.  Just  
wanted to check in and see what your plans were.........                  
Miss You,   K            ps-What is your address again?

FYI, the portland website has a similar chart that allows you to double-click the bar and get the detail of the outages, as well as detail about the plant characteristics, so that you may be able to use some of their code.

Dave,

Since I'm thinking of it, what we'd like to strive for is, for one, to be able to double click on the bars and get a list of the the plant outages that make up the total and also to be able to select date ranges.  Also, it would be be great to be able to be able to select daily or monthly averages over a day range or month range, respectively.  Maybe have the current page be the default with control boxes to modify the criteria.

Dave,

Hey, I checked out the test chart you did for outages.  Nice work!  I'm already thinking of many other things we'd like to have.  Does this charting tool, allow us to customize the chart features to the extent excel does?  Can you manually set the min and max values on the axis?  We like some of the charts to have the same axis settings so that the bars can be compared from one chart to the next.  If so, Jason can tell you how we'd like them set.  Let's also discuss what interactivity we can build into this page.

This is sumas.   Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).  Let me know if you need anything else.

Maria,

I think that the curve names are the same for index as for basis (which you currently pull), except that you specify the curve type as index instead of basis.  I've never looked in the database, so I've never seen the fields.  Hope this helps.

Hey, I installed SQL server...I feel like a real professional now.  Although, I don't remember exactly which table I'm looking for.  I found one that's MOD_Load that looks like it's the one.  If it is, where do I find what the Scenario ID field means?

Matt,

You have exceeded your VaR limit.  Per the rules set by John Lavorato I will have to take $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  If you are still over your limit tomorrow morning, the penalty will be $1,000,000.

Kimat,

For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.  I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.  It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.  I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.  Can you please look into this.  Thanks.

Mat

Ina,

A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.  You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.  Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.  Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.  Thanks.

Becky,

Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.

Mat

Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a month
ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and I'll
be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my layover is
for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out of
Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll call
your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch the
earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
Anyway, let me know what your plans are.

Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I see
each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at the
beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.

Chris,

Please add the following new point to the database for PGT (#15) and make sure we begin to scape it along with the others:

DRN:  288499
Name:  Klamath Cogeneration - PacifiCorp

This is a scraped point currently being posted.  This DRN is the same as the IHS DRN for this point.

Thanks.

Eddie,

We'll need a new pipeline for Northwest manual entry.  The point should have DRN JPINV, but no corresponding IHS DRN.  Please populate the database with a value of 16,460,301 with flow type S for 6/2/2001.  We will manually enter this point until we can automate it.

Phil,

How's this for starters...

 

The San Juan plant receipts and Rockies production information should be accurate.  The third tab, Keystone Receipts, is definitely not comprehensive.  That information is for El Paso Natural Gas only, and only the first section of the table has the receipt points values.  Unfortunately, a lot of production in Keystone moves onto intrastate pipelines that we do not have data for.  I'll see if I can get together at least some TW and Northern numbers for the Perm and that might be as good as we can get.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

I need to have an Outlook public calendar folder created to track maintenance shedules on West Region pipelines for the West Gas Trading Desk.  Patti Sullivan (psulliv) and I (msmith18) would need administrative rights.  Can you please direct me to the appropriate people to have this set up.  I can be reached at 3-0472.  Thanks.

Angela,

Please delete all data for PGT (pipeline 15) with effective date less than 12/1/00, and then load the attached file with historicals with effective dates from 1996 through November 30, 2000.  Please let me know if you have any problems.  Thanks.

Mat

Have not heard anything, and I've haven't had a chance to get back with her.  Since I didn't talk to her until late Monday, I didn't really expect to hear from her yesterday anyway.  I will follow up as soon as I get a chance.

We may have to request a check to pay for the information in advance, if my past experience is any indication.  What is your RC number, or would Tara be able to take care of it?  

Also, did you send this message before you finished it?  Looks like the last sentence is incomplete!  I assumed that you meant she would be my contact while you are gone.

Becky,

I was just wondering whether Questar ever got back to you regarding the historicals we requested from them.  As I understand, Lori Creer was going to check with her supervisors/management and get back with you.  I'll be out of the office Thursday and Friday.  In my absence, Tara Piazze

Thanks Chris.  According to Patti, Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up.  When, the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days.

Subject:	Harvesting Issues on 05/19/2001

We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
look and the following cycles did not get scraped:

05/19/2001
Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
Transco Cycle 2

05/20/2001
KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
Kern, Cycle 3
Northwest, Cycle 6

I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
for the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, is
definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
(this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
from as well).

As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
due to "Internal Server Errors".

Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.

Chris

Do you have VB6 installed on your machine? If you have I can show you a few lines to do an experiment to see if SendKeys work with your program at all. If not, please come to my desk after 2pm.

Per our conversation yesterday, I'd like to test the send key process for obtaining the Socal hourly storage postings.  Once I get the scheduling system opened and set, the following is the keystrokes required:


Enter
Alt-F
P
Enter
Enter

Of course, a slight pause between the keystokes might be needed.  And if we need to maintain activity to keep the system from kicking us out, we can simply use two Enter keystrokes.  Please let me know when you'll be able to give this a shot.

Thanks.

Becky,

I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In=
 their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the on=
e or two locations for which Enron has capacity allocations.  Chris Gaskill=
 indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent =
with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flo=
ws for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (onl=
y 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March =
1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel=
 free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

Matt,
   It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a rele=
ase capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide=
 daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effec=
tive if you would like.

Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers =
on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical dat=
a on all or most points on the pipeline.

Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeli=
ne.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward=
.  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data po=
sted on the web site

Chris,

I'm not familiar with the details of the reporting requirements for pipelin=
es under the current regs.  Can I get an interpretation of Questar's repons=
e to my request for historicals?

Thanks.

   I discussed your request with my supervisor and we are happy to provide
   you with the dialy use reports that you've requested for the points
   where you  actively move gas.  We do not have the resources at this time
   to provide data for all points on our system.  If you can give me a list
   of specific points I can get those for you by tomorrow afternoon.  I
   would suggest that you refer to our web site for other data.  Pipeviewer
   posts daily billing estimates for all meters and up to 30 days history
   for those meters.

   Lori,

   Can you please give me an estimate of when you can provide the requested
   historical flows we discussed yesterday.  I'm trying to manage a number
   of tasks that depend on this data,. and it would be helpful to know when
   it might be available.  Thank you.

Hey baby,
Well, as per usual, the plans are getting all botched.  Why can't people
just commit to a plan and roll with it?  Bill is now going to Disney...what
the f is that all about?  After checking into some new ideas (different
rental properties located near water) we quickly determined that that option
is near impossible at this late date.....	So, now we are trying a few last
ideas and have determined that most likely we will probably just have to
settle for chilling at the point, using Mom and Don's boat and tying up at
the sandbar with Kelly and Mike and their boat, bbq, beer and oh yea, lot's
of beer.  Come to think of it, that sounds great.  I think a few of my
girlfriends from Roch may join us as well.  Should be good!  So what does
your itinerary look likle?   love, k

I'll be home Wednesday night and I fly out Monday afternoon, but I don't really know which days I'll be up at the 1000 islands.  Depending on when I go up to the 1000 islands, I'll probably come back from the 1000 islands on Sunday in time for a little boating and binge drinking.  Would it be a good idea to plan a barbaque or something for Sunday?  Monday doesn't work for me because I'm flying back.  Jeff will be around in case you didn't know.  Anyway, I'll be in touch.

Tara,

It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).  So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.

Chris,

I recently found out that Questar posts a Clay Basin storage inventory in html on their website.  The link is http://www.questarpipeline.com/html/qpc_capacity.html.  We will need to start scraping this balance, specifically the "Total Clay Basin Annual Working Gas" and "Total clay Basin Reservoir Inventory".  This does not impact the storage Inventory issue that we've previously discussed, since this balance is currently a manual entry point, and will continue to be even after we start scraping these points.  Please give me a realistic estimate of when we can begin scraping this data.  We will need to create DRN's for both of these points.  Clearly, in terms of priorities, working out the bigger storage inventory balance issue is much higher priority.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mat

Juan Carlos,

The line you deleted simply saves the current record.  Deleting it will not cause any problems in a read-only database.  In the regular working version, deleting may result in edits to a record not being saved.

Mat

PS.  I hope things are well on the island.  Please pass along my regards to everyone.

Matt,
 
Long time no  hear, hope you're doing fine at the new company. Sorry to bother you  with this issue again since I know Leo Sommaripa has contacted you  already, so I'll be brief and to the point. 
 
We have been  trying to save a copy of the Database on a CD-R so that we can give it to the  client for their reference but some issues have come up which have to do with  programming. Our intention is for the client to keep the database in the CD and  to be able to access all the features in it so that there is no need for them to  copy it unto a hard drive and possibly modify the data.  Since by saving it unto a CD makes the database  read-only, there's no problem with keeping the data on the disk intact, and  we're even working on a disclaimer to paste on the database.  
 
The problem is  that by making it into a read-only file, some commands have become disabled.  Specifically, the buttons on the review form that access the compliance,  operations, equipment, and staffing forms are not available through the  read-only format. I ventured into the programming codes for the commands and  found the following string on all four buttons:
 
DoCmd.DoMenuItem acFormBar, acRecordsMenu,  acSaveRecord, , acMenuVer70
 
I temporarily  deleted that line from the programming codes for all four and so far have not  had any problems with accessing all levels of the database in the CD. Now, I do  not know exactly what that string does to the database but would much rather  find a safer alternative if possible or at least know that the string is  not a critical part of the process. If this is something that can be answered  right off the bat I'd appreciate it, I realize that this is not a priority  anymore so if its something that will consume  a extended period of time,  let me know and I will continue seraching through other  channels.
 
I guess this  wasn't brief after all and I appreciate the time and effort. I can be  emailed or I can make the arrangements to call you, whatever's better for  you.

Subject:	MDX NULL Status

Eliminating the effect NULL values have on MDX AVG's in History is progressing but has been filled with additional problems.

The solution to divide the sum from the cube by the count of nonnull days from SQL is practically done. In addition to 
all day Friday.  Five hours were put in over the weekend.  Much of this time has been spent resolving the underlying problems
that pose a problem to consistiency of results..

Done:
Develop query -- spRPT_GetAllDaysWithData
Parameterize query
Modify Program structure to call query with necessary parameters
Determine most complete cycle to use (Get cycle with most number of days of data) 
Verify Queries -- Started

To Do:
Determine how to use all retrieved cycles in NonNullDaysCount query.
Prove this approach is workable.

Tara,

It appears that from December 1999 back (although I haven't checked everything), Kern historicals were loaded improperly (wrong column from the website).  So, another major action item will be to reload those actuals.

Charles,

The attached table contains monthly flows to the referenced Southwest Gas meter points off of El Paso, Kern and PG&E.  As I indicated earlier, SWG may have deliveries off of Socal which we would not be able to see.  Also, there may be unidentified SWG meter points not included in the attached file, and we are missing some days of data so the actual numbers may be a little higher.  Finally, if this data is used for pricing/hedging analysis, one should be careful which prices they use for comparison.  SWG territory in California would be subject to California pricing, while that closer to the producing basins would be priced differently.  In addition, Southwest Gas owns transport capacity on El Paso, such that they were really only vulnerable to San Juan or Keystone price fluxuations, and not Socal.  You could only make a hedging estimate if you knew their transport capacity, which I do not (it is available on El Paso's website).  Anyway, that's all I have.

Just wanted to let you know that i'm having some flowers delivered to the house tomorrow (Sat) for Mother's day.  They couldn't give me a time, though.  I told them to leave them on the porch if noone is home.

Also, I just got invited to play golf at TPC, which if you don't know, is the venue for the Houston Shell Open.  A round costs at least $100, but free for me.  I better get to the range tomorrow.  Unfortunately every muscle in my body aches from working out and today we did arms, so i'm really in trouble.  Oh well.....

Talk to you soon.

As I was discussing with Duncan, I'm coming home Wednesday night and coming back to Houston on Monday late afternoon.  During some portion of the holiday, I'll be up at the islands, but i'm free to hang out for a day or so.  Are you around Thursday? Where would you go rafting anyway?  I'm definitely looking forward to the holiday, though.  A little barbaque, a little beer, a little boating, a little fishing, a little beer, a little golfing...I guess I should have taken the whole week off.  Anyway, give me a call sometime, and I'll try you when I get chance.  

Talk to you soon.

Chris,

For the following dates, we do not have Cycle 7 data in the database for PG&E (Pipeline #17).  These should have been reloaded from the saved html files.  Do we have these files, and if so, can you load the appropriate dates, in order the get the Cycle 7 data in for these points.


2/8/01
3/7/01	
3/8/01	
3/9/01	
3/10/01	
3/11/01	
3/12/01	


For the following dates, the data we have for Cycle 7 in the database does not match that in the spreadsheet that the west desk maintains.  We need to verify from the saved webpages whether our data is correct, and if it isn't, get it corrected.  I could check them, if you could print out the saved pages for me.	

2/12/01
2/27/01 
3/1/01 
4/11/01 	
4/16/01 	
4/17/01 	
4/18/01

For both of these, the actual date of capture will be several days later than the effective date for cycle 7.

Chris,

Per our conversation, the following table shows four storage inventories that we need to track/compute/report, etc.


Background

The west desk currently displays storage balances on several of the morning reports.  These balances are not reported by the respective pipelines, however, each day the injections and withdrawals are available.  In the past, our excel spreadsheets have tracked the running balances by simply adding the current daily activity to the prior day's balance.  As we get validation of the balances through phone calls, and/or postings, we tweak the balances to maintain an accurate representation.  Currently, our reporting/storage system does not allow us to make these balances available on our reports.

Task

Synthesize the currently used method of displaying storage balances for the storage facilities shown on the following table.  It is our intent to have a DRN established (and some already have been created) that would hold the storage balance each day.  However, this requires that a calculation be executed to determine the value to be placed in the database.  One possibility is to have the scraping script make the necessary calculation and store the new storage balance each time the pipeline is scraped.  Another possibility is to incorporate the ability to do these calculations in the report, while a third option is too keep a spreadsheet with storage balances that queries the database for the daily activity.  Lastly, these storage balances could be manual entry points, but would require manual calculation each day (representing a lower level of performance than the existing system for this feature).

Timeline

This is a necessary feature before transitioning from the current spreadsheets.  At a minimum, we need to have temporary system in place before the end of the week.  Although, we do not have a final date for transitioning, we see this as one of a few critical tasks.

Under the Power table in the Plant Outages folder on the fundy website, we have a link for California ISO outages.  Please change the link to point to the file called "pge_ISO_Outages.htm" in the testing folder instead of the existing file.  Thanks.

The balance of month Gas Daily product is called Kern Opal, but all basis and indexes are settled on the NWPL Rocky Mountains product.  These should be used for the plasma screen accordingly.

Colin,

Per our conversation, I have outlined Keith's task for the team....

Background:  Portland maintains in their database a table called "PlantOutage".  Records in that table each contain an outage "BeginOutageDate", "EndOutageDate", "CapacityOut" and "OutageReason".  Records also include a PlantID (key field for PlantCharacteristics table) and a PlantUnitID (key field for Unitcharacteristics table).  The PlantCharacteristics table contains a "WSCCRegion" field and the Unitcharacteristics table contains a "Fuel_Designation" field.  

Portland has a stored procedure that for a specified date range can calculate for each date the sum of "CapacityOut" for all outage records where the date falls between the "BeginOutageDate" and the "EndOutageDate".  I have inlcuded the results of this storaged procedure in the attached file.  Our task is similar but requires more detailed subgrouping of the data.

Objective:  The objective is to return the Sum of "CapacityOut" by each possible subgrouping for each day in a range (say 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2001).  There are roughly five possible parameters for "Fuel_Designation", seven for "WSCCRegion", and two for "OutageReason".  The resulting query would return approximately 70 values for each day within the specified range.

Format:  Ultimately we will have the date in one excel sheet with dates down the left and each of the 70 sub groupings across the top.  It would be most convenient if the results of the query were formatted in this way.  Alternatively, we can use a pivot table if the results of a list query are provided.  If the second option is used, we will need to get the data in two separate lists since excel can only hand 65,000+ rows.  In this case, we would use the "OutageReason" grouping (which only has two parameters) to split out the two lists.  


Thanks for your help.

Mat

Dave,

As discussed, I need to have daily power outages summarized by Natural Gas (NG) type plants and everything but NG for each WSCC region for the previous year and one year into the future.  The historical part of this task should be considered a higher priority.  Initially, I only need the results in Excel format so the West desk can work it into their forcasts.  We do not need any web interface at this time (maybe in the future).  Please let me know how long you think this would take and your availability as soon as possible.  If we can't get it done relatively quickly (say by wednesday), we might have to try a different route.  Thanks.

Mat

I am waiting for a response to an email I sent 1 month ago regarding your
database of facilities used to generate the daily plant outage list.  I
would like to cross reference the outage information you provide with other
data from other sources and would like an efficient way to "join" the data.
It would be helpful to me if I had a table of plants showing your text name
and a unique ISO or WSCC identifying code.  I can be reached at 713-853-0472
for any questions regarding this request.  Thank you.

Colin,

Great.  As we discussed, we'll need the final query to list all counterparties for each product with net quantities stated for each day (dates listed as column headings) of the current month.  Ideally, the query will be executed daily and posted in html or xls on the Gas Fundy website.  I understand that we do not yet have permission from EOL to hit their database regularly and that you will have someone else from your team finish out this task.  I'm available today to help any way I can.  Thanks.

Mat

The value should be 0 for R (the value moved from DRN 30685 which should have been changed to zero) and 30685 for D.  All the values were D's consistent with the existing data for DRN 30684 for those days prior to moving the R values over (which should be zeros for those days).

Chris,

Remember way back when......we threw out a bunch of PGE (#17) data that we were going to reload from the saved html files?  Anyway, it looks like we're missing data from 2/7/01 through 3/12/01.  As we discussed, we should have the html files so can we run those through the transform and get them into the database?  Let me know if there are any issues.

Chris,

I stumbled across a few problems with CIG/WIC.  First, location 2776 for pipeline has historicals loaded with flow type "D" yet new data is scraped with flow type "T".  Let's change all D's to T's.  Where dates overlap (key violations), just leave the existing Ts and scrap the Ds.  Second, please move the usage data for 279577 with pipeline number 6 to the same DRN with pipeline number 43 and delete the location under pipeline 6, as this is a manually entered point.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Yan,

As discussed, it is acceptable to rerun the cube at 6:30 am.  After the the refresh, the following West reports should be generated:  #25 CIG_WIC (daily), #40 Rockies Production (daily), and #9 Socal (daily, historical, merge).  Also, please generate the west flow summary report at 6:15 am.  In addition, #22 West_2 (daily and historical) and #38 West_3 (daily and historical) which run before the 2nd cube refresh should be among the first report run after the 1st cube run because they will be the first reports accessed in the morning by Patti (roughly 5:30am).  Let me know if you have any questions.

Mat

Jody,

I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.

Mat

Chris,

I assumed we were scaping the "Inventory Chagne" point for PGE, but it doesn't look like any data is in the database.  Can you check on this.  It's the last row of the larger tables on the webpage.  The location name I believe is Inventory Chang.  If it's not being scaped, let's get it started.

CIG (#42) is almost complete, but we have a few data changes to make:

First, for DRN 24906 Big Blue Meter Station, please replace the utilized capacity values of the records with effective date 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 with values below listed from 4/2/01 to 4/8/01 and delete records with effective date 4/21/01.  Also, please change all historicals from receipts to deliveries.

39982 	
32987 	
44781 	
41381 	
41357

Matt,
When you get a chance tomorrow, I want to show you some eol reports that I used to provide for the group.  Mike would like to have the fundies group provide this report for our group going forward.  My method is a bit inefficient..so I'm sure your group will be able to pull the data a lot easier; but, you'll be able to get the general idea from what I've done out of Access 97.
Anytime after 3 will be best for me since it is bid week.  Just let me know what works.
Thanks,
Mo.

Subject:	Manual Entry

I have the Manual Entry process ready for testing again (testing as in testing by the analysts).  I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential "bugs" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.

Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).

Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:

"Previous" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just "Yesterday" as before)...
There is now an option to enter data for a "special cycle 0"...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of '0' is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).
You can now add "extra" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the "Previous" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.

NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I'm open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)

I have also fixed the "Exceptions Occurred" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.

Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to "beautify" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.

Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.

Thanks,
Chris

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Subject:	Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to "unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages (portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Angela,

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Please make up an IHS id and the title should read, "Clay Basin Inj and W/D 
Historicals Only"

Thanks.

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 
Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional 
PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Subject: Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, 
it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key 
violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but 
do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key 
violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be 
great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate 
degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Here are the headers:

4.  FLOW_TYPE_CD
5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY
7.  AVAILABLE_CAPACITY_QTY
8.  PIPELINE_CYCLE_ID

These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files 
(they do not have to be in any particular order, but initially a template 
should be created, and then used throughout).  This format makes it a simple 
process to load this information into the database.

Thanks for all of your hard work!!

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

Yan,

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we 
discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report 
should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.

Chris,

Here are the additional manual entry meters.  Those highlighted in blue 
should already be in the database, while green highlighting designates new 
records.  Those without web DRN numbers need Enron designations which I will 
leave up to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Mat

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.   

Mat

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

Amanda,

Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary 
link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.  It should be 
called Kern Expansion Economics".  I don't have a description yet (and I'm 
still working on the other one I owe you).  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

Mat

waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

sorry i didn't write this sooner.  it sort of slipped my mind, i think 
because it went so smoothly.  so, yes, i changed the ticket and everything 
is all set.  i did have to put the $100 on my credit card, but don't worry 
about it.

later-

ps i got in another car accident that i didn't cause but still got blamed 
for it.  but we'll get into another time.

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

which I had to cancel my flying time!  Call me later.

and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities. 

Mat

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Hey you!

I just noticed that Enron has a HR Rotational Program opening on
flipdog.com.  Should I go ahead and submit it online or would have a better

Could you send me the StorageValue.xls and the curves spreadsheet you are 
reading from, please?  I'll test the model on my PC with the settings you are 
using.

Installing on another PC is no problem.

Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted
steve

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are

Spreads

Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.

Later.

Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

I have consulted my partner, and it would be great if we could be added to 
the reservation list.  Please pass this on to whoever.

I'm going to be working late, and I have some errands I need to run, so I 
don't really have plans, except that dinner will probably be around 8 pm or 
so.

Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

Mat

As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.

Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?

Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to 
figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she

Tom,

Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
decision making.  Speak to you soon.

Mat

I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was 
ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll 
just keep waiting.

Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
love, k

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Mat

Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password 
coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, 
so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the 
necessary software as well.  Thanks.

Ina,

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.  
Thank you.

you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my

Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
skiing!  

I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.

Stay cool.

Mateo.

I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.

you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Mat

OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.

well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another 
media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll 
attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about 
you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes 
someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being 
emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a 
friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i 
could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each 
other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't 
like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with 
us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want 
that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

let me know what you think...

That;'s funny.  I must have missed your call the other day.  Mark must not 
have given me the message or the answering machine is broke.  Regardless, 
I'll be available all weekend with my phone with at all times.  You could 
also try my work number as I'm working this weekend.

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k

Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a 
many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne 
and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities 
referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query 
facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order 
required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment 
inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at 
least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the 
table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as 
actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required 
for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.

So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
group on correspondance.

Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed 
early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9.

The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.  On American, 
the one's I sent are the about the only ones.  Continental has many available 
flights for about $35 more.

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

Hey,  do you have instant messenger?  You're the type of person that would 
utilize it to its fullest potential.  Anyway, I have it, and I think you 
should so you can send me an instant message.

Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
refresh it manually.  It sucks....

So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.

Later.

Jeanie,

As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El 
Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more 
info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be 
interested.  

See you around,

Mat

I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?

I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.

Everything went well, and you?  We are suppose to hear today!  I don't know 
what time...but I guess this means you haven't heard anything yet.  Let me 
know when you do, and I'll do the same.  I'm sure we both did fine, since 
they didn't give us the technical tests.

Pablo, 

Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not 
accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  

The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.

What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.

Pedro,

I'd like to help, but to be honest, I don't know what LPG stands for.  Is LPG 
a commodity? Gas pipeline? Pooling point?  Let me know, and I'll see what I 
can do.

ENRON ROCKS!

From: Office of the Chairman on 10/05/2000 07:55 AM
To: ClickatHome mailout
cc: =20
Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging 
out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I 
mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say 
about you.  Hope all is well.

I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I 
will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second 
or third rotation?

The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 
6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe 
I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Mat

Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat

Don't get too excited to hear about the rest of the day...I don't have much 
positive to write.  It's been boring and I'm very uneasy about my role in 
this group.  More later...

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Mat
